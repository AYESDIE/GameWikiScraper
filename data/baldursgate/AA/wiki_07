Their higher &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; also allows them to verbally communicate with other creatures, thereby giving some of them a &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; alignment when first encountered. Dialogue is brief and they instantly revert to enemies when finished speaking.\nThe most common variety of Yuan-ti mage is the 12th level version, and this is the only type encountered before the events in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;, except for the KPSHAM01.cre creature found of the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"De%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;de'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce a party member has been observed, and hostilities have begun the 12th level creature will self-buff with a spell contingency trigger (that cannot be disrupted) consisting of &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Minor Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;.\nA spell Sequencer can be deployed later containing &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe creature can also apply another &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; further into a battle under certain conditions, such as the first one being removed/spent. All of the spells listed in the info box are scripted for use, such as disabling and damage dealing spells. Additionally, the mage also has a scripted use of &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; that is not in the creature's memorized spell book. These spell casts can be disrupted. \nThe KPSHAM01 Yuan-ti mage found in the de'Arnise Keep second floor library uses the same mage script as the ICYUAN03.cre variety.\nLocations.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\n&lt;a href=\"de%27Arnise%20Keep\"&gt;de'Arnise Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s XP is 2,000,000 or greater, two Yuan-ti mage's will spawn in the following places:\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some revisions to two of the three versions of the Yuan-to mages in the game. It does not do anything to the ohnyuanm creature, as that mage has no spell casting script at all. It basically isn't used as a mage.\nThe only difference between the two modified versions of Yuan-ti mage with SCS installed is that the de'Arnise keep version (which has dialogue) is assigned an Invoker specialist mage kit. Otherwise, they employ identical \"Smarter Mage\" AI script. This means that the mages have an advanced threat assessment and opponent vulnerability capability, for better spell selection in combat and tactical behavior. \nThe mage has a mostly different selection of spells as well. See the Screenshot in the gallery above to see what self buffs are deployed at the outset of hostilities. Note that image is with SCS and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; combination installed. With SCS alone, it won't be very different, with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; Divination instead of SR's \"Dispel Shield\".\nThese Yuan-ti's also have a prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; loaded with &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;. Of particular note, these mages will cast a &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; spell, if able, at vulnerable party members in range. This can of course be deadly for an inexperienced party. Other offensive and disabling spell options are cast as well. \nSCS revises Yuan-ti mages with increased intelligence and dexterity commensurate with their race and class. Their adjusted Armor Class is typically -3.\nSCS Spawn content.\nThe mod has added several new creature files for Yuan-ti mages - these are:\nPlaced by TORGAL2.BCS.\nThe placement of these spawned mages is determined by the game difficulty setting. The higher the setting, the more mages are added, and they may be the level 14 variety with &lt;a href=\"TorGal\"&gt;TorGal&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, all of these mages behave as described above with the Smarter Mage AI. Each creature has its own Kit specific AI. So, there will different spells cast and different sequencers and spell triggers."}

This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature suffers 1d6 points of cold damage and loses one point of strength for 1 hour (no ability drain if the victim saves vs. death). The wizard gains a +4 bonus to hit the target and his touch is considered to be of +1 enchantment to determine what it can hit."}

{"id": "7588", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7588", "title": "Chromatic Demon", "text": "The Chromatic Demon is a &lt;a href=\"tanar%27ri\"&gt;tanar'ri&lt;/a&gt; fiend held captive in a magical cage on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe party encounters the demon on the second level of Watcher's Keep. The player will be able to learn a few facts and some history from the demon, as long as the party isn't obstinate and asks questions and doesn't shut down the dialogue. If the player does refuse to talk - the demon will just remark that the party is stupid and stubborn, and to return later when reasonable.\nAssuming the party agrees to learn that the demon's history is, eventually you'll realize that the only way to enter the portal (or \"gate\" as the demon calls it) to the next lower level of the keep is by negotiating with the demon. \nThe fiend will explain what needs to be done so that the demon can ensure the portal is opened - this will introduce a Journal entry for the &lt;a href=\"Gather%20the%20four%20scepter%20keys\"&gt;Gather the four scepter keys&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nThe party must obtain the four scepters to unlock its magical cage, and the demon says the party will then be free to use the portal.\nDemon forms.\nThe party will notice that the creature is constantly changing form, even in its cage.\nThe demon will periodically polymorph into one of four forms, continuously. Each form has a weakness to a specific &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20damage\"&gt;Elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; type(s), and clues about this are given in texts on this dungeon, as well as statements made by the &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Elemental%20Level%29\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;:\nGameplay.\nThe demon while in its cage is invulnerable to targeting and all status effects and damage that a player can deliver in normal gameplay.\nWhen the party interacts with the demon's cage while in possession of the four elemental scepters, the cage is unlocked via the fiend's dialogue, and it is released and will turn hostile. At this time scripted actions take place that remove three undroppable items from the demon, including the &lt;a href=\"INVULNER.ITM\"&gt;INVULNER.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RIDRING.ITM\"&gt;RIDRING.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"GORCHR.ITM\"&gt;GORCHR.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. These items were mostly responsible for making the creature immortal and immune.\nOnce the battle begins, the demon will attempt to move towards and harm any creature in range via melee attacks. It uses no spell casting or special elemental attack powers. Approximately every three rounds, the demon will change form, cycling through them, one after another, and repeating the cycle until destroyed.\nThe problem with this creature is its very high physical resistances. As shown on the InfoBox, it limits the player to specific &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20damage\"&gt;Elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; type(s) that can affect the particular form the demon assumes.\nOn the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;Magical damage&lt;/a&gt; will hurt the demon no matter which form the fiend has taken. However, the demon is immune to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; projectiles. The creature is not protected against &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Set%20Spike%20Trap\"&gt;Set Spike Trap&lt;/a&gt;. A powerful party could blow up this demon with a few well-placed spells or seriously damage it.\nThe demon has no magic resistance either. Other than certain status effect immunities, many different spells can affect the demon.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorpal\"&gt;Vorpal&lt;/a&gt; weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sword\"&gt;Silver Sword&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Planetar\"&gt;Planetar's&lt;/a&gt; attack can potentially decapitate the fiend in a single blow.\nA balanced party should be able to overwhelm the demon using magical and elemental damage, inflicting more damage than the demon can return in the same span of time. A solo play through will complicate this battle.\nWhen defeated, the fiend 's corpse remains. There is a pile of loot that can be collected, including the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Key\"&gt;Portal Key&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ixil%27s%20Spike%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;magical dagger&lt;/a&gt;, and an unusual &lt;a href=\"Circlet%20of%20Netheril\"&gt;circlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolo play note.\nFor solo non-spellcasters - If you try to kill the demon with melee attacks, it will strike back and be able to overcome a good AC rating. Keeping your health up will prove a challenge. You can use the Sling of Everard +5 as a \"Kiting\" weapon (or other infinite ammo source), and especially &lt;a href=\"Foebane\"&gt;Foebane&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Flail%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Flail of Ages&lt;/a&gt; are good weapon choices. Standard physical damage will typically only produce 1 to 2 HP loss per hit upon the demon. Scores of successful hits will be needed to kill this fiend.\nImmunities and special characteristics.\n\u2022 The Chromatic Demon has the standard immunities shared by most demons:\n\u2022 In addition, it has:\nNote: It will lose immunity to poison and poison damage while assuming the form of an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Elemental%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Air Elemental&lt;/a&gt;. Mechanically, this is done by the script when the form changes to the Air Elemental form - the &lt;a href=\"RINGDEMN.ITM\"&gt;RINGDEMN.ITM&lt;/a&gt; is swapped to the CDRNGCHR.ITM, which provides no immunity to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise they are the same. When the Air Elemental form changes to another, the process is reversed.\nGame edition differences.\nIn the original only, the Chromatic Demon has the following characteristics in addition to everything else:\u00a0\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod, and especially the \"Improved Fiends\" component will revise the Chromatic Demon. it has all the immunities of the unmodded game, plus as follows:\nChromatic Demon (cast at 28th level):&lt;br&gt;\nIts melee attack deals 3d6 +7 crushing damage and is a +3 enchanted weapon, with a 0-speed factor&lt;br&gt;\n170 Hit Points. &lt;br&gt;\n100% resistant to all &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n100% resistant to all &lt;a href=\"Magical%20damage\"&gt;magical energy damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; \nImmune to poisoning and poison damage (The mod gets rid of the ring swapping mechanic).&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to instant death, &lt;a href=\"Slay\"&gt;Slay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kill%20target\"&gt;Kill target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n50% resistant to fire and cold damage, even in its vulnerable form.&lt;br&gt;\nRemove Magic and Teleport without Error, at will.&lt;br&gt;\nIn addition to melee strikes it will also use a revised \"Chain Lightning\", Unholy Fireball, a modified 30d4 \"Cone of Cold\", an acidic blob attack based on the acid blob trap, and an \"airburst\" attack based on the dragon's\" Wing Buffet\", at will, when in the appropriate form. Some of these innate spells bypass magic resistance and have other modifications.&lt;br&gt;\nThe creature's AI is much improved and will recognize opponents who are protected against its attacks and try to teleport to a vulnerable target. Will change form about every two rounds or so. The Air form can only be harmed by acid. In the slime form (looks like a shambling mound) it can only be hurt by electricity. In the Ice golem form can only be harmed by fire. In the Demon form can only be harmed by cold. \nPoison, physical damage, and magical damage will \"not\" work on any of this demon's forms. \nObviously, most all of the gameplay and suggested methods to destroy this demon in the basic game are now rendered less or ineffective with SCS. The creature is also more difficult to hide from (weaker party members will be chased down via teleport movement). Soloing will be tougher as well. Concentrate on delivering the appropriate damage type to the vulnerable form, and it can be defeated.\nNote that SCS has added changes, so the demon is less likely to get \"stuck\" or be barred from moving in tight spaces. It can now move normally behind its cage and will bump through other creatures who attempt to block it/surround it, and of course it can teleport without error as well, at will."}

In this case the damage will be negated and consume a single mirror image instead, but the other effects will still be applied if the saving throw fails.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Chromatic Orb\" requires that the caster hurl the orb at a target and make an attack roll to hit it. The caster can also select which colored orb is desired, limited to a selection based on the caster's level. A gem worth at least 50 GP is required as a spell component as well. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, saving throw and school.

When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly towards its target. The sphere inflicts magic damage and causes different effects depending upon its color. As the level of the caster improves, both the damage inflicted and number of colors known increases. The color of any given orb is chosen randomly from the colors known at the wizard\u2019s level. The orb is occasionally even multicolored, causing multiple effects. The victim can save vs. spell against all special effects but gets no save against the damage.

Two side quests take place inside the tent:\nUnder the Illusion Spell.\nWhen the party enters the tent they will discover an area that is affected by a very powerful illusion spell. Further exploration of this area will reveal that it contains four large areas that vastly surpass the volume of the real tent as seen from its exterior.\nIllusion Exterior Area.\nThis is the area the party enters into first. It contains a large, blue-hued, ornately patterned, domed tent-looking structure that's surrounded by water, with a wide bridge leading to its horseshoe-arched entrance. When walking over the bridge, a &lt;a href=\"Genie%20%28Circus%20Tent%29\"&gt;Genie&lt;/a&gt; will greet the party. He will allow passage over the bridge if given the correct answer to his first or second riddle, or the party will have to kill him. Answering the first riddle gives the most experience points while killing the genie gives the least.\nIf the party chooses to explore the wide, exterior walkway that circles the outside of the domed structure, they will encounter several &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; creatures. The werewolves are illusions while the shadows are real undead that will deal real damage and can &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;drain strength&lt;/a&gt; with a successful hit. Killing each shadow gives the party .\nAs for the illusionary werewolves, as long as the party does not attack or cause damage to them by a hostile action, the werewolves cannot do any damage when they strike. However, if they receive any damage, their illusionary attacks change to real attacks and then they can hurt the party. Killing the werewolves gives no XP.\nFirst floor.\nUpon entering this large circular area, the party is first greeted by the winged elf &lt;a href=\"Aerie\"&gt;Aerie&lt;/a&gt; who has been transformed by an illusion spell into an &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;. She will ask to be freed from the illusion with the help of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Ogre%27s%20Sword\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; which can be obtained from some &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Circus%20Tent%29\"&gt;Peasants&lt;/a&gt; who are located nearby.\nA woman named &lt;a href=\"Hannah\"&gt;Hannah&lt;/a&gt; is also in this area, appearing as a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt;, again by the illusions of this odd place. As part of the \"Find the boy's mother inside the circus tent\" side quest, &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can inform her that her &lt;a href=\"Giran\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; is safe and is waiting for her outside the tent.\nAfter dealing with Aerie one way or another, the party will encounter the &lt;a href=\"Pleasure%20Slave\"&gt;Pleasure Slave&lt;/a&gt; who is standing in front of another large horseshoe-arched doorway, and who has some bizarre announcements and warnings to offer up to the party during conversation. Afterwards, the party can proceed to the next area through the doorway.\nSecond floor.\nThis area is another large circular room that contains more illusionary werewolves and real shadows and the party will be instantly attacked by the creatures upon entry. After killing all the monsters, the genie from the bridge will re-appear on the stairs to congratulate the party on their progress and question them on their willingness to proceed with the \"little game\". Regardless of the party's answer, he'll eventually leave via a dimension door and the party is free to proceed up the stairs to the next doorway.\nThird floor.\nThis last doorway leads to yet another circular room in which the gnome illusionist &lt;a href=\"Kalah\"&gt;Kalah&lt;/a&gt;, in the guise of an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Mage\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt;, awaits the party. The gnome &lt;a href=\"Quayle\"&gt;Quayle&lt;/a&gt;, a former companion from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, is also here, having been transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt;. Kalah will taunt the party while two shadows and another werewolf attack. Only Kalah needs to be killed to break his illusion spell.\nAfter the Spell is Broken.\nWith Kalah's illusion broken, the inside of the circus tent reverts back to its normal appearance. A dying Kalah, having changed back to his regular gnome appearance, is found lying on the floor of the tent. After some brief banter he'll die for good.\nKalah's Loot.\nKalah's body will lie on the ground for some time, allowing the party the chance to search it for the following items:\nCharacters.\nAerie will be here if she didn't join the group during the investigation quest. Hannah will also appear here as her normal self and upon being spoken to, she'll thank the party for helping her before leaving the tent to rejoin her son. Quayle is also here looking like his normal self.\nMod content.\nMods.\nInstalling the &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business (Baldur's Gate II)&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the component called &lt;a href=\"Kalah%20%26amp%3B%20What%20He%20Was%20Promised\"&gt;Kalah &amp; What He Was Promised&lt;/a&gt; is a new quest that follows up on the Circus Tent quest. How did Kalah get such amazing Illusionary Powers? Why did he create a realm inside the Circus Tent? The mod sends the party to find out, leading to a potentially challenging and satisfying conclusion."}

{"id": "3329", "revid": "283504", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3329", "title": "Classes", "text": "Classes define a creature's role and profession. There are four groups of classes: warrior, priest, rogue and mage. Classes in each group, with a few exceptions, follow the same basic rules and have access to similar &lt;a href=\"high-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; pool.\nA creature's class affects nearly all aspects of the rules: the weapons and armor they may use, whether they may cast spells, and which spell books they use. The class also grants the creature special abilities, passive effects, and defines which benefits they gain with level advances.\nSome classes have strict requirements and are available only to creatures of particular races or &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;s, but all have minimums in certain &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;ability scores&lt;/a&gt;. Many characteristics of classes are further altered by which are modified versions of the basic classes.\n\"Note: Innate abilities of &lt;a href=\"Multi-class\"&gt;multi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dual-class\"&gt;dual&lt;/a&gt;-classed characters are cast at the average of their class levels, rounded up.\"\nKits.\nAfter picking a single class in \"Baldur's Gate II\" and \"Enhanced Editions\" of the games, you can choose a class kit. Class kits modify the base class by adding bonuses, replacing special abilities, and balancing these with penalties. Some class kits have restrictions that differ from those of the base class.\nMage specializations are treated as mage kits from \"Baldur's Gate II\", Barbarians are treated as a fighter kit in \"Enhanced Editions. \"The following table only reflects the state after \"EE\" version 2.0.\nRace restrictions.\nThe following table lists which classes are available to which races. Generally if a class is available to a race, then all its kits are also available, with exceptions noted under the table. Humans can select all (single) classes and kits except for the fighter kit Dwarven Defender.\n\u2020 &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; kit availability differs by race. Gnomes are automatically Illusionists and can neither be unkitted mages nor &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Mage\"&gt;Wild Mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nMulti-class.\nNon-human races may choose to multi-class at character creation, advancing in two or three unkitted classes simultaneously. Multi-class creatures gain the advantages and abide by the limitations of every class in the combination. They divide their &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; among their classes, so they progress in levels more slowly than single class creatures. Any XP gained are stored in total. and the XP values displayed in the character record screen are rounded down after total XP is divided by the number of classes. The rounding down is solely for display purpose, so there\u2019s no actual XP loss. The XP cap applies to the whole character though, and not each class. This means a double multiclass in BG2EE and further will hit the XP cap when both classes reach 4 millions XP, while a triple multiclass will reach the cap at about 2.66 millions XP.\nDual-class.\nHumans may not MULTI-class, but can instead DUAL-class. They can start dual-classing any time after reaching Level 2 in their initial class, kitted or unkitted. By doing so, they cease to advance in their current class and start to develop a new, unkitted class from its Level 1. Once they have thus dual-classed into a second class, they cannot go back to the first (i.e. they will never be able to gain levels in their starting class). Furthermore, the abilities of the first class become unavailable until the second class reaches one level beyond the level of the first class. A single character may only ever dual-class once, even if the requirements are met for more than one new class.\nIMPORTANT: The &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience cap&lt;/a&gt; in \"Throne of Bhaal\" is 8,000,000, and experience points from both the exact XP requirement of the level of the first class and the total XP from the second class count towards this total. Please make sure that there're sufficient points left available to progress high enough in the second class.\nGameplay.\nNotable breakpoints for Fighters:\nNotable breakpoints for Druids:\nNotable breakpoints for Rangers:\nIf wanting to backstab with every attack: Assassin (9,13,17,21) to Mage (up to 31,29,27,24), for &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Weapon\"&gt;Poison Weapon&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally the ultra powerful combination &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt;, is often chosen since Multi-class Mage/Thief can not go above level 20 Mage.\nLevel 1 Necromancer &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; (up to level 12) grants bonuses on &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;Slay Living&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (priest)&lt;/a&gt; without prohibiting any cleric spells. This also grants access to many useful mage spells (including &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; for truly difficult saving throws of any cleric spell) while still allowing 39 levels of cleric.\nBugs.\nSpecialists of none.\nDue to a bug, class kits other than specialist mages are treated as specialists of the \"\" school. In the &lt;a href=\"original%20edition\"&gt;original edition&lt;/a&gt; only, they get a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells, abilities and other effects used against them when they belong to the NONE school. Conversely, they inflict a -2 penalty to their opponents' saving throws when trying to affect them with spells, abilities and other effects of the NONE school. On the flip side, as \"specialists of none\", they receive a -15 learning chance penalty when trying to learn spells from all scrolls. The specialist's +15 bonus to their own school only applies to scribing &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Cow\"&gt;Summon Cow&lt;/a&gt;, the only scroll teaching a spell of the NONE school, unavailable through normal gameplay.\nAll kitted dual-class characters made through the game's character creation feature are affected by this bug. Some unkitted companions are also affected, being inappropriately configured by developers: Anomen, Imoen in \"Baldur's Gate II\", Mazzy, Sarevok, etc. Many unkitted NPCs and enemies are specialists of none as well.\nEffects that belong to the NONE school include:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s, kit values other than TRUECLASS and the 8 specialist mages are still seen as specialists of none, and companions, NPCs and enemies are still misconfigured, but all of this only affects chances to learn from spell scrolls. Saving throw concerns do not apply.\nArchived content.\nRestrictions on the choice of second class when dual-classing:\nHP will be locked at the value it was at when you choose to dual class until you regain use of your first class. After that you will gain additional HP according to your second class. Ex: a level 9 fighter with &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; of 18 has 126 HP dualed into mage; even at fighter (lv9) &gt; mage (lv9) s/he still has 126 HP; but once s/he reaches fighter (lv9) &gt; mage (lv10), the HP goes to 132 and the character starts to gain HP as a mage now.

It affects nearly all aspects of the rules: the weapons and armor they may use, whether they may cast spells, and which spell books they use. The class also grants special abilities, passive effects, and defines which benefits they gain with level advances.\nThere are twelve classes, each of which has three or more subclasses that further alter the character's capabilities. Unlike previous games, there are no &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28BG3%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; restrictions \u2014 all classes are available to all races. \nEach class has two \"saving throw proficiencies\", for example Dexterity and Charisma, which adds the character's proficiency bonus to any saving throws using that ability score.\nMulticlass.\nMulticlassing is an advanced option that allows a character to have two or more classes. This can lead to powerful combinations, but at the expense of higher level class features.\nWhen a character levels up, the player can choose to add another class instead of leveling up their original class; this is done by selecting the \"Add Class\" option on the Level Up screen. The character retains all the weapon proficiencies, spells, etc of their original class, but further progress in that class is halted.\nFor example when a level 4 Fighter levels up, they can either become a level 5 Fighter, or add the Bard class to become a level 4 Fighter + level 1 Bard.\nThere are no restrictions on combinations of race and classes. However it is advisable to use combinations that work well with the character's Ability Scores."}

There is also a smaller variety, the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Lesser Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;. \nGameplay.\nThe cay golem is the same general size as the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;Flesh Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Golem\"&gt;Brain Golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis particular category of golem is 100% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;resistant to magic&lt;/a&gt;; however, this can be overcome by casting &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt; first or by using spells that ignore magic resistance (&lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; etc.). \nWeapons-wise, they can only be harmed by magical weapons dealing &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; (if no suitable weapons are available, this can also be accomplished with summons or transformations that have crushing attacks, such as the main character's &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;). \nThe only elemental effects that can harm this golem are &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; (although at only 50%) and &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;Acid damage&lt;/a&gt;. \nSee the Info Box for specific immunities.\nThe golem's melee attack dishes out 3d10 &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; and it is modified by their superior strength. The fist attack counts as a +4 enchanted item for the purpose of what it can strike. They typically only strike once per round, but under the effects of their innate &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; ability, their &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;Attacks per round&lt;/a&gt; increase to 2.\nClay Golems normally empower themselves at the beginning of combat with a \"Golem Haste\" innate ability. This bestows them with a \"normal\" &lt;a href=\"Haste%20effect\"&gt;Haste effect&lt;/a&gt;. It should last for 72 seconds, but it can be dispelled. The haste effect is also applied to the golem's allies (if there are any) in a 15 ft. radius around the creature when the ability is initiated. The golem's movement rate will also double while hasted. \nThey can be found in many locations in the saga.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the installation of the \"AI Enhancement's\" component improves many aspects of creatures encountered in the game. In regards to golems, the mod implements the following:\nImproved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT/EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a sensible range, makes them immune to \"Lower Resistance\", and tries to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind barricades. It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes iron golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds. As of SCS version 22, it also gives clay golems a cursed-wound weapon, as in PnP Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\nSCS revises the typical Clay Golem fist melee weapon &lt;a href=\"GOLCLA.ITM\"&gt;GOLCLA.ITM&lt;/a&gt;. When the golem hits a target, it applies an instant \"Cursed Wound\" effect (DW#CURSE.spl).\nThe golem hit inflicts its rolled damage, but that damage is now Cursed. \nUpon a hit, a lighting animation will play over the target, the combat log will show a text display \"\"Cursed\" and another one that says \"Unable to Heal\"\". This means that any damage incurred by this weapon cannot be healed by normal means (such as a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Light%20Wounds%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Cure Light Wounds (spell)&lt;/a&gt;. However, a &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; effect can heal this damage.\nIn order to get rid of the \"curse\", you need to apply a &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/a&gt; spell or similar. Otherwise, this cursed wound is permanent. It also has no saving throw to negate, ignores magic resistance, cannot be dispelled, and has &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; 0 and so will bypass spell protections.\nWith this component the clay golem is immune to all the status effects in the unmodified version, plus the following spells and additional status effects: &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;Poison damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; innate ability is initiated at the beginning of hostilities, and again, every three rounds thereafter.\nThis golem now has a melee attack range reach of 2, instead of the unmodified creature's range of 1.

It is best used by the player directing its movement and who/what to target.\nIf left to make decisions on its own during battle, the script it is furnished is very simplistic and may not perform to the player's liking.\nWhen the golem detects an enemy creature, it will self-initiate a &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Haste\"&gt;Golem Haste&lt;/a&gt; spell over itself and can affect nearby party members as well.\nThe golem will act as a basic melee fighting creature usings its bludgeoning fists to beat on a target.\nThe golem can be useful as a distraction, especially against magic spell casting oriented creatures, such as a mage, lich, or beholder, due to its immunities and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe golem is also impervious to all &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; except for &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis golem can be buffed by the party to increase its effectiveness, such as with a &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Evil%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Evil (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nThe golem will disappear from the map when 1 turn expires.\nA &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; will destroy/banish this golem, as its gender is \"summoned\".\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes a few revisions to this particular golem.\nThe default AI script is modified, so that if the golem is allowed by the player to do its own thing, it has a decision logic that evaluates if an enemy is protected by &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and then may try a different available target to pummel.\nIt also recognizes when its fists get a \"weapon ineffective\" result and will look for a different target.\nThe golem will reapply its golem haste after several rounds have elapsed (if it isn't already under a haste effect).\nThe mod makes the golem immune to the spells &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plant%20Growth\"&gt;Plant Growth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;. It is also immune to &lt;a href=\"Webbed\"&gt;Webbed&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nNote that with SCS the clay golem's &lt;a href=\"GOLCLA.ITM\"&gt;GOLCLA.ITM&lt;/a&gt; fist weapon applies a \"Cursed Wound\" effect upon a hit.

For the version in and refer to &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;Cleric (Baldur's Gate)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduction.\nClerics are best known as healers.\u00a0They are members of divine priesthood who are granted the ability to cast &lt;a href=\"priest%20spells\"&gt;priest spells&lt;/a&gt; from the gods they worship. Unlike mages and bards, who scribe scrolls to learn new spells, clerics and druids automatically know all spells of any spell levels they have unlocked. Clerics must select the spells they want to memorize for the upcoming day and then &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; before they can cast them.\nClerics\u00a0can wear most types of armor, with the exception of mage robes, just like &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s. Their ethos prohibits them from using weapons and missiles with sharp points and edges. In some ways, clerics are similar to &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;. While paladins may use \u2014 and become more skilled with \u2014 a wider variety of weapons, they have only one alignment and one race to choose from.\nClerics are exceptionally versatile characters, and being able to wear any armor while casting spells allows them to take any position on the battlefield (front, middle, or rear). They also have the second best THAC0 progression after fighters, and slightly above rogues. Because of their utility from a catalog of divine spells, the ability to play any alignments or position, and their healing/buffs, they can be a good choice as the main character for first-time players. \nCleric may be used as a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Multi-class\"&gt;multi-class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; option with fighter, ranger, mage, or thief.\nCharacter abilities table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, other Races have modified ability scores.\nSpecial abilities.\nTurn Undead.\nClerics and paladins have the ability &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures. When this mode is activated and undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a possibility they will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. Whenever the cleric or paladin gains a level, this mode will become more powerful. Good-aligned clerics and paladins may use this mode to destroy the undead instantly (or make them run away), while evil-aligned characters can use it to control the undead for 10 rounds. After the duration of the effect ends, the undead will become hostile to the party.\nGameplay\nCleric spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0have access to cleric spells up to spell level 4. Cells in\u00a0light\u00a0blue are cleric specific spells, which are not usable by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClass kits.\nCleric.\nThe Cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. Though Clerics are both protectors and healers, they are not purely defensive - when evil threatens, the Clerics are well suited to seek it\u00a0out on its own ground and destroy it. The opposite is true of evil Clerics as well, and there\u00a0are also many variations in between.\nClass features:\nGameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Helm\"&gt;Priest of Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowers of &lt;a href=\"Helm\"&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, the neutral god of watchers and protectors are warriors in their own right and are often seen as defenders of the innocent. For more about this deity see:\n&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Lathander\"&gt;Priest of Lathander&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lathander\"&gt;Lathander&lt;/a&gt; is the good god of renewal, creativity, and youth, and is celebrated nearly everywhere. His followers are very popular throughout the realms, and there are numerous wealthy temples devoted to him. For more about this deity see:\n&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Priest of Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; is the evil god of storms, destruction, and rebellion. Clerics of the Stormlord warn that Talos must be appeased, or he will rain destruction upon the land. For more about this deity see:\n&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Tempus\"&gt;Priest of Tempus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tempus\"&gt;Tempus&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor. For more about this deity see:\n&lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Priest of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; is the deity of law and justice and is primarily concerned with the punishment of wrongdoers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. The belief in justice through (benevolent) force, or at least armed vigilance, is the reason for Tyr's existence. Tyr holds great prominence in the pantheon due to his position as leader of The Triad, a trio of lawful good gods that are collectively devoted to the concepts of courage, justice, perseverance, relief of suffering, duty, obedience, honor, and to some extent, righteous martyrdom.

The progression is slower than that of a single-class cleric of course, but not prohibitively so. This multi-class inherits the weapon restrictions of the cleric.\nAs a mage, the character has access to higher &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; and arcane spells.\u00a0 The progression is slower than that of a single-class mage of course, but not prohibitively so.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the player should keep in mind that they are unable to cast spells while wearing any armor (with few exceptions), which complicates one of the cleric's advantages.\u00a0 They can eventually select every mage\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-Level Class Ability&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0but due to the required access to 9th level spell slots, they are significantly delayed in acquiring them.\nGameplay.\nCleric / Mages have a wide spell repertoire and are therefore regarded more as a spellcaster than a combatant. However, this wide spell selection also allows him to engage in combat if one wishes to. Both classes have combat buffs (&lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;), defensive combat protections (&lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;), offensive combat protections (&lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt;), and touch spells (&lt;a href=\"Harm\"&gt;Harm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Touch\"&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Magic\"&gt;Righteous Magic&lt;/a&gt; makes &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt; deal maximum damage.\nThe C/M can benefit from casting time reduction effects like the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt;, which is not usable by single-class clerics. Since long casting time is very common among divine spells, this is a notable advantage. &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; also affects divine spells.\nThe most unique feature of this class combination is the ability to access divine spells in (&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt;, and (&lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt;. This can set up a huge variety of unique effects:\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so. It is generally preferable to dual from cleric to mage, as your HP is better and mages have a slower growth, benefiting more from higher levels. However, dualing in either direction involves significant sacrifices for the first class, making this combination generally more powerful as a multi-class.\nKit Comparison for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level Ranges for Dual-Classing:\nNote: In the original \"Baldur's Gate\", it is possible to select a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; kit when dual-classing to mage as long as the character meets the secondary attribute requirement for the specialization. These characters lose their specialization when imported to \"Shadows of Amn\" as this feature was removed, and the Enhanced Editions do not allow it.\nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value.\nSpecial Abilities of the Cleric / Mage.\n&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nClerics have the ability to turn undead creatures. When this mode is activated and the undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a chance they will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. As the character's level increases, this becomes increasingly powerful.\u00a0 At very high level differences, &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; factors into this effect; good and neutral clerics can outright destroy undead, and evil clerics can permanently charm them.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbol\"&gt;Holy Symbol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen clerics reach level 25 (7,650,000 XP for the multi-class), they obtain a in form of a ring, based on their patron &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; if not having chosen one. All Holy Symbols give the wearer +1 &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, +5% &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and one extra and level spell slot (only if unlocked); these effects are cumulative with other sources.

These abilities are available at level 14/14, reached at 3,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis class gains all HLA's from the standard cleric and mage pools.\u00a0 Note that any HLA may be selected regardless of the class which is leveling\u00a0up.\nNote that, because of the required access to certain spell slots (notably 9th level spell slots for the 10th level mage HLA's), most mage HLA's will not be selectable until the class reaches mage level 18 at 6,000,000 XP.\u00a0 The player will have enough level-ups available\u00a0to select all mage HLA's if they choose.\nAs all cleric and mage HLA's can only selected once, there are several level-ups where the C/M will be unable to choose an HLA. Also, all cleric HLA's technically require 7th level cleric spell slots, but these will always be gained before HLA's are available.\nSpell Progression.\nPriest Spells.\nThe C/M\u00a0gains spell slots identical to those of the unkitted\u00a0cleric; however, because of their slightly slower progression, they will have less spell slots during the course of normal play.

It is the only multi-class option for the Ranger, and only half-elves may select it.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0can\u00a0&lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0this combination as well with the sufficient stats.\nIntroduction.\nThe Cleric / Ranger is very similar in abilities to the &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, and as such has many of the same strengths.\nAs a ranger, the character benefits from high &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt;, low\u00a0&lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, multiple attacks per round, and advanced &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;weapon proficiencies&lt;/a&gt;. This enables the character to act as a frontline melee character, though it will never be as good as a pure ranger in that respect. They also gain the special abilities of the ranger, including bonus starting proficiency in Two-Weapon Style, the selection of a racial enemy, the ability to hide in shadows, and access to &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; spells (although the exact selection varies by version of the game).\nAs a cleric, the character has access to &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; and divine spells. The progression is slower than that of a single-class cleric of course, but not prohibitively so. This class inherits the weapon restrictions of the cleric. It also doesn't remove the body armor restriction of ranger kits, Archer, Stalker, Beast Master.\nGameplay.\nOriginal Saga.\nIn the original games, the C/R gains cleric and druid spells for all spell levels. This makes them arguably the strongest divine casters in the game, even compared to single-class clerics and druids.\nThe addition of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Skins\"&gt;Iron Skins&lt;/a&gt; in particular makes them incredible tank characters, and the &lt;a href=\"Insect%20Plague\"&gt;Insect Plague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Beauty\"&gt;Nature's Beauty&lt;/a&gt; spells are great disabling tools that the F/C has no substitutes for. This makes them a highly unique and powerful combination.\nEnhanced Editions.\nIn the Enhanced Editions, the C/R gains cleric spells for all levels, but druid spells up to level 3 only. As these levels are generally considered poor for the druid, this advantage is quite limited. Compared to the F/C, the C/R gains numerous very small advantages (racial enemy, stealth, bonus Two-Weapon Style specialization, etc.) but loses the potential racial bonuses of the dwarf, gnome, and half-orc and will progress more slowly. The druid spell level limitation can be turned back off by changing the option from to in Baldur.lua file (located in the 'Documents\\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition' directory).\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Dual-Class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s can dual class if they meet the attribute requirements for doing so. As with other dual-class combinations, it is generally preferable to dual from ranger into cleric, as your HP is better and clerics will benefit much more from their uncapped progression than a ranger will. Note that a cleric must be &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; in order to dual-class to ranger.\nNote: Divine spells are always cast at the cleric's level even if the ranger's level is higher. This diminishes the spellcasting ability of C&gt;R dual-class.\nKit Comparisons for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level Ranges for Dual-Classing:\nNote: In the original (non-enhanced) games, weapon proficiency points\u00a0must be spent before being allowed to leave the level-up screen. Because dual-classed characters typically receive more proficiency points than single-class characters, and because the Archer and Beast Master kits have unusually restrictive proficiencies, R&gt;C dual-class characters may be unable to level-up in some situations, which will result in the game being stuck on the level-up screen with no way to exit.\u00a0 Unkitted rangers and Stalkers will not encounter this issue, regardless of the level of the dual-class.\u00a0 The following table lists the extra points that will be granted if the dual class starts at the listed levels as an Archer or Beast Master.\nThese points must be wasted if the character is to reach their normal level cap.\u00a0 Points can be wasted in one of two ways:\nIn the Enhanced Editions, you will still be forced to spend weapon proficiency points when they are open, but if it is impossible to spend then you will still be able to complete the level-up, bypassing this issue.\n&lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no companions in the series with this class combination.\nAbility Scores Table.\n^ - Rangers have access to percentile strength.\nSpecial Abilities of the Cleric / Ranger.\nAdvanced Weapon Specialization.\nThis class may Specialize in any weapon, allowing them to invest up to two points into a specific &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Weapon Proficiency&lt;/a&gt; (Cleric weapon restrictions still apply, and any proficiency points not put in staffs, maces, clubs, morningstars/flails, hammers, slings or fighting styles are wasted for Rangers dual-classing to Cleric). As a result, rangers may do more damage and hit more often with weapons from the specific proficiency. The C/R may still invest three points into Two-Weapon Style.\nNote that the C/R gains a one-time bonus of two points in Two-Weapon Style at character creation. This is granted in addition to their normal points.\n&lt;a href=\"Racial%20Enemy\"&gt;Racial Enemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn character creation, rangers select a racial enemy. When fighting creatures of that species, they gain a -4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and +4 damage bonus. The exact list of creatures varies according to game. When importing a ranger to \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt;\", they may reselect a new racial enemy.\n&lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;Charm Animal&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers have the special ability to charm animals. They get one use per rest at level 1 and gain additional uses every 2 levels afterwards.\nHide in Shadows.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt;, the ranger can hide in shadows as long as they are not wearing heavy armor. Rangers start with 25% Move Silently and 20% Hide in Shadows; this is affected by their &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;racial bonus&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Dexterity\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. They add between 5% and 8% to each skill at each level-up, capping at 109% MS and 104% HiS at level 13.\nThe chance to hide successfully depends on environmental factors such as time of day and presence of shadows.\u00a0 While the ranger cannot &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; (unless they have the &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;Stalker&lt;/a&gt; kit), they still have a -4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus when attacking from stealth with melee weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nClerics have the ability to turn undead creatures. When this mode is activated and the undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a chance they will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. As the character's level increases, this becomes increasingly powerful. At very high level differences, &lt;a href=\"Alignment\"&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; factors into this effect; good and neutral clerics can outright destroy undead, and evil clerics can permanently charm them.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbol\"&gt;Holy Symbol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen clerics reach level 25 (7,650,000 XP for the multi-class), they obtain a in form of a ring, based on their patron &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; if not having chosen one.

The progression is slower than that of a single-class cleric of course, but not prohibitively so. This multi-class inherits the weapon restrictions of the cleric, so it gains some weapons but loses others.\nAs a thief, the character has access to &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bing. This allows the character to act as an assassin for devastating damage, to detect and disarm traps, to hide in shadows in order to scout ahead of the group, to pick locks, and to pickpocket. The thief also requires the character to give up heavy armor in order to use its skills (with few exceptions). The player should also keep in mind that the backstab ability only works with weapons usable by a single-class thief and build their proficiencies accordingly.\nGameplay.\nThe Cleric / Thief is generally not considered as synergistic as the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, although it still has unique interactions that make it stand out. Both cleric and thief provide support roles, providing buffs and opening locks respectively. Rather than dedicating two party slots for both roles, it may be beneficial to combine them to one. Both classes also level up fast making them well suited dual or multi class.\nThe weapon selection of the cleric means that quarterstaves and clubs are the only valid backstab weapons for a C/T.\u00a0This isn't a major downside in either game, as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt; (the best weapon for backstabs in Baldur's Gate and one of the best in Baldur's Gate 2) is available in both games: very early in BG2 and a bit later in BG, but the player can use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Spear\"&gt;Staff Spear&lt;/a&gt; (the second best weapon for backstabs) early in that game until they get the other staff.

It can be used\u00a0while unlocking objects or looting containers, which break normal stealth and invisibility, so can still be effective as a scouting tool. It can also be used to &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Find_.2F_Disarm_Traps\"&gt;clear a room of traps&lt;/a&gt; without being noticed by the enemies.\nThe C/T may hide in shadows after using\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt; or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Globe of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to deal major damage by walking near enemies without breaking stealth.\nFinally, at very high levels, the C/T may select &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; as an HLA, which will allow the class to equip any weapon.\u00a0 This will give them more backstab-compatible options; however, they still cannot place &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;proficiency points&lt;/a&gt; into any weapons besides those of the single-class cleric.\u00a0 They may also cast mage spells from scrolls, allowing them limited access to some of the tactics of the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mage&lt;/a&gt;, which can be quite powerful.\nSince they have access to &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt;, this is the only class combination that can equip both a &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbol\"&gt;Holy Symbol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heartwood%20Ring\"&gt;Heartwood Ring&lt;/a&gt;, giving them two extra 6th and 7th level spell slots, giving them a lot of spell options in the late game.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the usual recommendation for dual-classing is to dual\u00a0from the high HP class to the low HP class, the cleric benefits much more from uncapped progression than the thief.\u00a0This makes the T&gt;C generally more recommended, even though they lose &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt;.\nKit Comparison for Dual-Classing:\nCommon Level Ranges for Dual-Classing: \nAbility Scores Table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value.\nSpecial Abilities of the Cleric/Thief.\n&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nClerics have the ability to turn undead creatures. When this mode is activated and the undead creatures are in range of the character, there is a chance they will stop attacking their targets and run away from the character until the effect is worn off. As the character's level increases, this becomes increasingly powerful.\u00a0 At very high level differences, &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; factors into this effect; good and neutral clerics can outright destroy undead, and evil clerics can permanently charm them.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Symbol\"&gt;Holy Symbol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen clerics reach level 25 (7,650,000 XP for the multi-class), they obtain a in form of a ring, based on their patron &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; if not having chosen one.

It's an old iron mine which was originally the home of the dwarven Orothair clan, yet most members were killed when they accidentally breached an underground river, subsequently flooding the mine. At present, the mine has been secretly retrofitted and is currently in full operation by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Throne\"&gt;Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Their work force is made up of mostly enslaved men, most of which have been taken prisoner during caravan raids, with a few even tasked with making weapons and armor from the iron ore that has been mined or stolen from raids.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Davaeorn\"&gt;Davaeorn&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of operations at the mine, running things from its deepest depths.\nThe immediate area surrounding the Motte-and-bailey fortification is relatively peaceful, with the occasional wild group of &lt;a href=\"Tasloi\"&gt;Tasloi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; appearing.

Within each building is a low-tier guard with some helpful information; one immediately flees before pointing the party in the direction of the mine entrance via dialogue, while the second will be hostile, but will point the party in the direction of Davaeorn via dialogue after being charmed. The second island merely contains the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%20Mines%20Shed\"&gt;entrance&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cloakwood%20Mine%20level%201\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a guard-post type structure when viewed from the outside.\nJournal Entry.\nEntering this area for the first time marks the &lt;a href=\"Important%20Events%23Cloakwood\"&gt;Important Events:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Important%20Events%23Cloakwood\"&gt;Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; entry in your Journal as completed, and creates the &lt;a href=\"Important%20Events%23Crippling%20Cloakwood\"&gt;Important Events:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Important%20Events%23Crippling%20Cloakwood\"&gt;Crippling Cloakwood&lt;/a&gt; journal entry."}

Most of the game's NPCs, all summons, and many humanoid\u00a0bosses, were not above Level 4 and so were instantly killed by this spell. NPCs were not (and still aren't) intelligent enough to leave the area of effect, so if they could not see the player they would die a toxic death. However, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are immune to poison effects.\nCloudkill's impact in the original game was limited by its availability, as only a random mage in an out-of-the-way dungeon and a hidden cache contained scrolls, and wizards restricted by the level cap could not memorize Level 5 spells. \nThe increased level cap in Tales of the Sword Coast allowed Cloudkill to be memorized, but it is less overwhelming in the expansion areas, where monsters have higher stats and magic resistance against the spell's effects. Certain, unexpected bosses in these areas can still be \"cheesed\" with Cloudkill, however, such as the Phoenix Guards in Durlag's Tower.\nCloudkill remains powerful and useful early into Shadows of Amn but loses potency (along with most low-level spells) past Spellhold.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Cloudkill\"&gt;Wand of Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; also applies an emulated version of the spell, but not the actual spell.\nWhere to obtain its scroll.\n\"Shadows of Amn\".\nTreasure\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Cloudkill\" has a few differences than the BG video game spell's version. See the External links for further reading.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, school, and description. See below for description:\nCloudkill\nLevel: 5\nSchool: Conjuration\nRange: Long\nDuration: 1 turn\nCasting Time: 5\nArea of Effect: 30\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 Hit Dice, and cause creatures with 4 to 6 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with -4 penalties or be slain. Holding one\u2019s breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those with more than 6 Hit Dice must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect. Undead creatures are not affected by the poisonous cloud."}

Each time an action is performed in combat, the game simulates the rolling of one or more dice to determine the result. The dice roll is referred to by a code in the form: number of dice, followed by \u201cd,\u201d followed by a numeral for the type of dice. For example, one 6-sided die is \"1d6\"; five 12-sided dice are \u201c5d12.\u201d\nArmor class.\nArmor Class (AC) is the protective rating of a type of armor. &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; provides protection by reducing the chance that a character is attacked successfully (and suffers &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents it. Penetrating the armor of a &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; in full plate mail to cause any damage is no small task.\nArmor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to \u201310, the best (very powerful magical armors). The lower the number, the more effective the armor. &lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; can also improve the AC of a character.\nHigh &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; gives a bonus to Armor Class.\nDamage.\nDamage is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully. Damage can also occur as a result of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20damage\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20damage\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acid%20damage\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; types, and anything even remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks is measured in &lt;a href=\"hit%20point\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;s. Each time a character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It can be as little as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted from the character\u2019s current hit point total. When this reaches 0, the character is dead.\nMelee.\nMelee is any situation in which characters are battling each other hand-to-hand, whether with &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt;s, teeth, claws, swords, &lt;a href=\"axes\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;, pikes, or something else. &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; is a valuable asset in melee.\nMissile combat.\nMissile combat is defined as any time a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; is shot, &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20weapons\"&gt;thrown&lt;/a&gt;, hurled, or otherwise propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but there are special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile combat; a character's &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, for example, affects their &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;chance to hit&lt;/a&gt;.\nTHAC0.\nTHAC0 is an acronym for \u201cTo Hit Armor Class 0.\u201d This is the number a character, NPC, or monster needs to attack an &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; 0 target successfully. THAC0 depends on a character\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;. The THAC0 number is used to calculate the number needed to hit any Armor Class. THAC0 improves as the level of a character increases.\nSaving throws.\nSaving throws are measures of a character\u2019s resistance to special types of attacks \u2013 &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character increases in &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeed factor.\nSpeed factors are numbers between 1 and 10. The lower the speed factor of a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, the more quickly the character wielding that weapon begins their sequence of attacks.\nCasting time.\nThe casting time of a &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; is the amount of time the caster is busy doing the motions of casting before the spell\u2019s effects take place. Only one spell per round can be cast. Even if you cast a spell with a short casting time, you must wait until the end of the round before starting your next spell.\nThe attack roll.\nAn attack roll is a simulated twenty sided die roll (1d20) that determines whether an attack succeeds or fails. The attack is successful if the result of the die roll is equal or higher than a certain number. This number is called the \u201cto-hit\u201d number.\nAttack rolls are used for attacks with swords, &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, rocks, and other &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, as well as blows from &lt;a href=\"fist\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt;s, and other hand-to-hand attacks.\nThe to-hit number.\nThe to-hit number is the result of subtracting the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; of the target from the attacker\u2019s &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;. The attacker has to roll the resulting number, or higher, on 1d20 to hit the target.\nExample: \"Rath is a 7th level fighter. His THAC0 is 14, which means that he needs to roll a 14 or better to hit a character or creature of Armor Class 0. In combat, Rath, attacking an orc wearing chainmail armor (AC 6), needs to roll an 8 (14\u20136=8) to hit the orc. An 8 or higher on 1d20 will hit the orc. If Rath hits, he rolls the appropriate dice to determine how much damage he inflicts.\"\nIn a typical game combat situation, THAC0 is modified by weapon bonuses, strength bonuses, and the like. The actual to-hit number is the result of subtracting the target\u2019s Armor Class from this modified THAC0.\nExample: \"Rath is still a 7th-level fighter. He has a Strength of 18/80, which gives him a +2 bonus to his attack roll. He fights with a long sword +1. His base THAC0 is 14, which is modified to 12 by his Strength and to 11 by his weapon. If attacking the orc from the earlier example, Rath would have to roll a 5 or higher on 1d20 in order to hit (11\u20136=5).\"\nIf the die roll on 1d20 is equal to or greater than this adjusted to-hit number, the attack succeeds. If the roll is lower, the attack fails.\nModifiers to the to-hit number.\nMany factors can modify the number a character needs for a successful hit. These variables are called modifiers to the to-hit number or to the attack roll.\nStrength Modifier: A character\u2019s strength can modify the to-hit number, altering both the chance to hit and the damage caused. This modifier is applied to melee attacks.\nMagical items: The magical properties of a weapon also attack rolls. &lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s that give a bonus to the attack roll or Armor Class often are identified by a plus sign. For example, a sword +1 may improve a character\u2019s to-hit number by one. A suit of chain mail +1 may improve the Armor Class of the character by one over the protection provided by a non-magical suit of chain mail. (In this case, the magical version has an AC of 4 while the non-magical one has an AC of 5). may have a negative modifier (a penalty), resulting in a subtraction from the attack roll or an addition to Armor Class.\nThere is no limit to the number of modifiers that can be applied to the to-hit number or the AC, nor is there a limit to the positive or negative number (the total of all modifiers).\nIf the target is &lt;a href=\"sleep\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;ing or held, the attack automatically hits and causes normal damage."}

Some will join you quite easily with only the exchange of a few words, while others may require you to fulfill your promise of helping them pursue their goals before they come to the decision of longtime commitment. All companions have &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt;s, unique personalities, and perspectives, which make them either support or despise your decisions. These include: party &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;s, or even other members' opinions, forcing the player to choose sides. The &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;main character&lt;/a&gt; can also develop &lt;a href=\"romance\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt; relationships with certain companions.\nYou may have up to six characters in your party, main character included. In \" \", you may also choose to play with a fully customized party like in the \"&lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Dale\"&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/a&gt;\" series, with the first character you &lt;a href=\"Character%20Generation\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; being your main character. Companions come with various &lt;a href=\"classes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;ability scores&lt;/a&gt;. It\u2019s up to player's imaginations to innovate their own ideal parties. \nIn classic versions of the games, companions who are under-leveled at the time of joining will have their levels automatically adjusted based on the average party level. In Enhanced Editions, however, they\u2019re given a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; (XP) for you to manually level, based on the protagonist current experience which grants the player more control of their status. \nThe XP is granted on thresholds of 4K, 8k, 16k, 32k. In the thresholds are 64k (the game's starting XP), 69k, 90k, 110k, 161k, 200k, 250k. In the thresholds are 125k, 160k, 250k, 500k, 750k, 1mil, 1.25mil. The highest XP they can have at the time of joining is 32,000, 250,000, 1,250,000, and 2,500,000. Each time the party gains XP, the game will try to divide them evenly among characters; undividable points are then distributed according to positions of the character portraits from \u201ctop\u201d to \u201cbottom.\u201d The main character has the tendency to gain more XP than other party members. There\u2019re also cases in which each character gains an equal amount of XP individually. None of the companions' statuses from Baldur's Gate or Siege of Dragonspear carry over into Baldur's Gate II, but all companions' statuses from Baldur's Gate carry over to Siege of Dragonspear (if they appear there) with the exception of Imoen.\n\"Baldur's Gate\" companions.\nRecruitment.\nCompanions can be recruited at their indicated spot.

Conster will not speak before his master does.\nThrough various dialogue choices with Firkraag, the party may eventually make it clear to the dragon that they cannot leave without Garren Windspear's child (who is still upstairs locked in a cell). Firkraag, does not at the moment, wish to kill the party and is willing to let the party live their life. He warns the party though:\nConster speaks a line of dialogue, and teleports back upstairs. He'll be ready for the party when they come back to rescue the child. \nOn the other hand, if the party attacks either Conster or Firkraag himself within the dragon's hideout - then both the mage and dragon will immediately go hostile and attack the party as well. From a game challenge standpoint, this is the most difficult scenario since the party will face two opponents at the same time, instead only the one. If the party set out to destroy Firkraag, then this can be done without regret - in fact it will achieve all the party's goals. That is, unless the PC is a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; and will be pursuing the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Stronghold%20Duties\"&gt;Paladin Stronghold Duties&lt;/a&gt;, and then the optimal time to attack Firkraag may be later.\nConster will apply a battery of instantly cast spells at the start of conflict (uninterruptible).

His next spell application will be &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter that the mage will recognize spell caster classes and could try to take out that target with a combined &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; a few game tics later.\nA &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; is scripted for use at the third nearest enemy.\nThe second nearest enemy to Conster will be targeted with a combination &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Stone\"&gt;Flesh to Stone&lt;/a&gt;.

The mage is still a conjurer, but has a revised spell book with many different memorized spells, and more conjuration variety.\nIn battle, Conster will apply a series of buffs (previously cast) to include: &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Invocation&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR Mod&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;Protection From Normal Missiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Cold\"&gt;Protection From Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. Also added to the group will be a conjured &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards the SCS AI script will conduct threat recognition and opponent vulnerability assessments. This guides the offensive and other spells cast next. Conster can remove magical defenses with &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;. If enemy summoned creatures are detected, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; can be cast.\nA prepared &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; are ready to deploy during the battle, near instantly.\nAs a conjurer, Conster has a good number of summoning spells to add allies to attack the party, including a &lt;a href=\"Djinni\"&gt;Djinni&lt;/a&gt;, Fire and Air Elementals, and some high-level creatures. The mage has some random SCS potions for consumption during battle to heal or boost abilities and is scripted to quaff them.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; all the mages spell will be the SR versions. Summoned/conjured creatures will have the SR stats and abilities, but combined with SCS will also have improved AI scripts (like the spell casting Djinni)"}

All &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; can be resurrected regardless of their constitution score provided their body is salvageable, that is, the companion's hit points haven't been reduced below \"-10\", or been turned to stone and subsequently shattered. On normal difficulties and below, companions can be resurrected even if their body was destroyed.\nMod content.\nIf the \"Boareskyr Bridge Scene\" mod is installed, in a +1 constitution boost is gained by taking the third choice when crossing the Boareskyr Bridge (Evil Choice).

The uses for this spell are limited only by the imagination of the wizard.\nGameplay.\nThe caster can only apply this spell upon themself.\nWhen the spell casting is initiated a brief casting animation occurs and then a contingency creation menu opens up. \nThe first menu screen instructs: \"ADD SPELLS TO YOUR CONTINGENCY\" - select an available spell from the memorized spell book(s) available (Wizard or Priest if applicable), and it must be a 1st-level spell through 4th-level.\nNext, select one \"Condition\" to trigger the contingency, and then select a \"Target\" of the contingency, as follows: \nAcceptable conditions are:\"Wizard is hit (but not necessarily damaged)Wizard sees enemyWizard's Hit Points are at 50%Wizard's Hit Points are at 25%Wizard's Hit Points are at 10%Wizard is &lt;a href=\"Helpless\"&gt;Helpless&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., stunned, held, paralyzed, asleep, webbed etc.)Wizard has been poisoned\"\nAcceptable targets are:Self\nWhen finished with the process, click the \"DONE\" button, and a brief contingency creation animation graphic plays over the caster's sprite. Additionally, an icon is placed on the character's portrait titled \"Contingency Active\".\nSince the duration is unlimited until triggered, you can memorize the Contingency spell and the spell you want to put in it, cast Contingency, then replace Contingency in your memorized spells and rest. That way, you still have Contingency active after rest but also have two more spell slots for the next encounter.\nOnly one Contingency can be active at the same time. One &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; and one Contingency can be active each.\nContingency will trigger even if the character is immobile due to a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mages&lt;/a&gt; can also put Cleric spells into the Contingency. E.g. automatically &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; yourself at low hit points.\nContingency can trigger successfully even in dead magic zones (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20-%20Balor%20%28AR3008%29\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Balor chamber&lt;/a&gt;, however, it must be prepared before entering the area.\nMod content.\nRegarding this type of spell, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will do the following, but only if you do not install &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;:\nAllow players to use the individual versions of Spell Immunity in triggers&lt;br&gt;\nSpell Immunity is really eight sub-spells. This component allows a subspell to be placed into a Contingency or Spell Trigger.&lt;br&gt;\nOn Enhanced-Edition installs, this is done crudely, by introducing scrolls of the eight different versions of Spell Immunity. ToBex allows it to be done more smoothly on original-game installs.&lt;br&gt;\nMake spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages&lt;br&gt;\nIn the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc. are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency. This will not take effect if you have Spell Revisions installed (as SR takes care of this already by making them \"Universal\" School).\nWith &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; installed, this is the equivalent spell description:\nContingency&lt;br&gt;\nLevel: 6&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Universal&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: Special&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 1 round&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: Special&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: None&lt;br&gt;\nUpon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being \u2018the wizard reaches 50% of his maximum hit points\u2019. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of his total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him. This requires no action by the wizard, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members."}

Up to four circlets can be made before the machine's ability is exhausted. \nAdditional background, some explanation of the machine and other pertinent dialogue can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Leader%20%28Illithids%29\"&gt;Slave Leader (Illithids)&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach circlet has one charge available that can launch a projectile with a 4 feet range at any targetable creature in the game. The creature will be exposed to a Dire Charm effect that bypasses all protections and magic resistance. There is no saving throw against the effect. The creature will be Dire Charmed for an 1800 duration. During this period, it can be commanded to do some activities, such as attack another creature in melee combat, move where directed, and other very limited actions.\nAs this charmed creature relates to the &lt;a href=\"Captured%20by%20Mind%20Flayers\"&gt;Captured by Mind Flayers&lt;/a&gt; quest, the circlet can be employed to take control of an illithid, and force it to open doors that are psionically sealed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20Brain\"&gt;The Master Brain&lt;/a&gt;. Those specially locked doors can only be opened doing this action, or by the protagonist turning into the &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;.

Also, if you dismissed either &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt; or Edwin, they can all be found in the tavern if you want to re-hire them. &lt;a href=\"Yoshimo\"&gt;Yoshimo&lt;/a&gt; can also be here if you dismissed him, but only before &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%204\"&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt; due to plot reasons.\nCopper Coronet patrons and gameplay.\nThere are several patrons including commoners, noblemen and various drunks in the tavern public bar and also in the rear/upstairs \"exclusive\" areas. All have dialogue if you engage. Some have specific lines and opinions depending on who is in your party. There are lines for &lt;a href=\"Viconia\"&gt;Viconia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anomen%20Delryn\"&gt;Anomen Delryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Jansen\"&gt;Jan Jansen&lt;/a&gt; and others. One particular drunk (a \"fat man\" animation\") has quite a long and burp filled tale about his recent mugging assault and heroic defense. Don't miss it! Try speaking with everyone you can. There are clues, nonsense, folly, and insight available.\nFor first time players, speaking with everyone you can in here is the best way to go. Enough clues are provided for you to figure out how to get into the back rooms of the Copper Coronet. So, no spoilers here about that. The wiki is sure that you can crack that nut and solve this by playing the game.\nUpon first visit to the Copper Coronet, a local bully named &lt;a href=\"Amalas\"&gt;Amalas&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by two other toughs (or \"Ruffians\"), will address the protagonist. If the PC is a female the volley of antagonistic insults will be different and quite annoying. Amalas is trying to goad the PC into the \"fighting pit\" for a fight to the finish, most likely to prove his prowess and also for some side bet wagering opportunity. The PC can agree and have a one on one fight or try and deescalate the situation with various dialogue choices. However, if Minsc is in the party and with a female PC, this is not going to end peacefully, as the Ranger won't stand for the bullying and attacks the ruffians. \n&lt;a href=\"Anomen\"&gt;Anomen&lt;/a&gt; will speak to the party if you get close enough to him. He can join the party if desired. Anomen has his own quests if in the party.\n&lt;a href=\"Hexxat\"&gt;Hexxat&lt;/a&gt; can be found near the staircase to the second floor. She'll initiate a call for help, trying to get the party to assist with visiting a tomb and promise of great treasure. She's behaving strangely, and her speaking ability seems unnatural. You may take her into the party as a companion if desired, or leave it alone until later, or never. This is BG2EE Content only, for those who are still playing the original game.\n&lt;a href=\"Korgan%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Korgan Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt; is also in the tavern. The party must initiate conversation with him. He can also join the party as a companion. Korgan has his own quest if in the party.\n&lt;a href=\"Nalia%20de%27Arnise\"&gt;Nalia de'Arnise&lt;/a&gt; will approach the party when she sees the group. She'll ask for assistance with a problem. If desired, she can join the party as a companion, or be sent ahead and met later, or the party can temporarily decline speaking with her until later (or never). She is the only way to get the &lt;a href=\"The%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20has%20been%20Invaded\"&gt;The de'Arnise Keep has been Invaded&lt;/a&gt; quest, and that quest is also the only way to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20the%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20and%20Lands\"&gt;Ruling the de'Arnise Keep and Lands&lt;/a&gt; stronghold quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jierdan\"&gt;Lord Jierdan&lt;/a&gt; does not initiate conversation, but he does announce out loud to anyone within a certain range that he has an offer if the party wishes to hear it. If so, initiate dialogue with him.\n&lt;a href=\"Yarin\"&gt;Yarin&lt;/a&gt; located in a room upstairs has special dialogue if Yoshimo is in the party and he speaks with him. Give it a try.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiana\"&gt;Tiana&lt;/a&gt; is on the tavern floor. She's angry and looking for her husband &lt;a href=\"Rumar\"&gt;Rumar&lt;/a&gt;. If you find Rumar and his clandestine fling &lt;a href=\"Priss\"&gt;Priss&lt;/a&gt;, you can then let Tiana know that you spotted her husband upstairs. Tiana will then march upstairs and straight over to Rumar and Priss. A fight will break out between the two women. If the party intervenes and helps kill Tiana there is a XP reward, and some rich &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt;. If the party helps slay Priss, that results in a reputation loss for an innocent. Or the party can just watch the encounter and hear all the delicious dialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Salvanas%20di%20Riyos\"&gt;Salvanas&lt;/a&gt; is smooth talking character. Special dialogue is available for any female party members that speak to him individually, such as the PC, Jaheria, Aerie etc. It is unique for each person, and humorous as well. \n&lt;a href=\"Madame%20Nin\"&gt;Madame Nin&lt;/a&gt; is located upstairs. Speak with her to hire some temporary love. If someone in the party does, then speak with the companion to get insight into their status, and it will add more to the impressions that the Copper Coronet is engaging in some morally questionable activities. There are also additional girls upstairs, already with clients. Speaking with them add even more information to consider. If any of the companions complain that you are asking too many questions, Madame Nin may ban you from further paid companionship. If Yoshimo is in the party, there is special dialogue with the girls, and some humorous lines if he speaks with one of the other patrons with his hired companion. After the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Hendak%20and%20the%20slaves\"&gt;Free Hendak and the slaves&lt;/a&gt; quest is complete, Madame Nin will abscond from the Copper Coronet.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, several doors in various areas, including this one, would disappear when opened, leaving no way to close them. This is identified for correction in the pending Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP).\nReference: (ar0406.are, ar0711.are, ar1302.are, ar1307.are, ar1307.are, ar5007.are)"}

One or more 14th level Cowled Enforcer &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Conjurers&lt;/a&gt; appear, accompanied by an &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Centurion\"&gt;Amnian Centurion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amnian%20Legionary\"&gt;Amnian Legionaries&lt;/a&gt;, and/or others, under the following circumstances:\nMagic ban enforcement.\nThis Cowled Enforcer (codice_2) is a 20th level generalist &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; who upholds the law against the illegal use of wizardly magic. He can appear in any district except for the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Graveyard\"&gt;Athkatla Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst infraction.\nThe first time a party member casts a wizardly spell illegally (i.e., without having first bribed, or rather \"purchased\" a license from, &lt;a href=\"Corneil\"&gt;Corneil&lt;/a&gt;), a Cowled Enforcer will appear and warn you not to do it again.\n\"The practice of magic without a license is forbidden in the city of Athkatla. You shall receive one warning only. Further spellcasting will result in your death. ...those who are not Cowled Wizards or are without a proper, approved license may not practice magic in this city. Licenses are subject to the approval of the Cowled Wizards, providing you are a responsible and sane practitioner. Seek a representative of ours in the Council of Six Building in the Government District, if you wish. Continue to use magic without approval and you will be labeled a deviant and dealt with appropriately. Fail to heed this warning at your own peril.\"\nHowever, the party member may cast wizards spells for the rest of the day, even transitioning to other districts to do so, without being attacked. After the party has rested once (8 hours), casting another wizard spell results in another enforcer appearing.\nSecond, third and fourth infraction.\nThe second through forth times an illegal spell is cast, this same type of Cowled Enforcer teleports in and says:\"You are unlicensed! This is an unsanctioned use of magical energy! You have been warned.\"He calls in three other Cowled Enforcers for backup (codice_3) before attacking.\nFifth and final infraction.\nThe fifth and final time, the Enforcer says,\"Your transgressions against the Cowled Wizards has come to an end.\u00a0 Prepare to feel the wrath of the highest members of our order.\"The Cowled Enforcer then calls in help from the more powerful Cowled Wizards. As shown in the gallery screen shot, if all these mages are defeated, the total XP gain is 58,000 shared by the party.\nBackup enforcers.\nThese two types of Enforcers are called in for backup during the second through fourth infractions of the magic ban. Both are female Elven Conjurers:\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises some aspects of these mages, and especially if the \"Smarter Mages\" component is installed. In general, the mages will deploy instant cast self buffs after teleporting into the area and after any initial dialogue is spoken. There is a noticeable short delay time gap before that occurs, giving the party a chance to attack or deploy a quick launching spell, before the preparatory buffs take place. If you want to give the AI a chance (for challenge) then wait for the buffs to fully deploy before attacking - this will compensate for the unintentional game engine lag, which occurs due to so many scripts trying to process in a short period - an unfortunate Infinity Engine limitation. On the other hand, not waiting a few tics will give the party a starting advantage.\nIn terms of the Cowled Enforcers teleporting in to punish the party for casting arcane magic in Athkatala, without a license - SCS will always send a total of four mages per transgression. The mages experience levels are adjusted by the game difficulty setting, with the \"Hardcore\" and \"Insane\" settings being the toughest. Depending on the difficulty setting will also determine if the higher-level mages use particularly powerful level 9 spells and even mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; against the party. The mod makes the Cowled Enforcers much more difficult to defeat, absent \"cheese\" tactics or exploits.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod installed; all spells cast by these enforcers will be the SR versions.\n&lt;a href=\"%23Top\"&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%23CowEnf1\"&gt;Enforcer\u00a01&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%23CowEnf\"&gt;Enforcer\u00a02&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%23CowEnf3\"&gt;Enforcer\u00a03&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%23CowEnf4\"&gt;Enforcer\u00a04&lt;/a&gt;"}

(For details on all four enforcers, see the page for &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Enforcer\"&gt;Cowled Enforcers&lt;/a&gt;.) \nIf you defeat them, you'll be able to cast spells freely until you rest or enough time passes, but then, the same group will appear again when you cast. Killing them does not lower &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating this repeating encounter a total of five times, the next time you cast a spell the Enforcer teleports to the casting location and announces:\nThe Enforcer then calls in help from three more powerful Cowled Wizards, including a named mage: &lt;a href=\"Zallanora\"&gt;Zallanora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating this final, unique group of Cowled Wizards, the attacks stop and you will be free to cast spells even without a license.\nThe Cowled Wizards will also not bother trying to enforce the magic ban against a party of &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; 3 and under (though such a party will be hunted by them in other occasions).

This component extends their watch to most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (there are a few exceptions, mostly places where wizards live (e.g. Prebek's tower) or where it's likely that the owners have made arrangements with the Cowled Wizards (e.g. the Copper Coronet).\nIncrease the price of a license to practice magic in Athkatla (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)\nThe default price for a magic license from the Cowled Wizards is 5,000gp. This component allows you to increase it to an amount between 10,000gp and 50,000gp, depending on which option you choose during installation. These options are useful to realistically manage the abundant gold that accumulates, well beyond the player's needs, to make the party's purse feel more realistic and balanced. Otherwise, money is never an issue in the game - and it probably should be a factor that needs to be considered, and a resource with implications."}

Almost every container is trapped as well. It might be a prudent idea to reserve a party slot for a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thief&lt;/a&gt; or one of its variants with ample thieving skills to sniff out and deal with the danger ahead.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Outside&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you arrive at the tower the first person you'll come across is &lt;a href=\"Erdane\"&gt;Erdane&lt;/a&gt;, He's a merchant that has items for sale, some of which are quite useful in the exploration of the tower. The toughest enemy encountered on the outer grounds of the tower are a pair of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Horror\"&gt;Battle Horror&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Doppelganger\"&gt;Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Guard\"&gt;Doom Guard&lt;/a&gt; and another Battle Horror are also lurking about the grounds, mostly upon the inner wall surrounding the tower. A high value item, &lt;a href=\"Rashad%27s%20Talon\"&gt;Rashad's Talon&lt;/a&gt; is located in a nook on a chimney pipe that is located on the rooftop.\nBasilisks.\nOn the second floor of the tower, one of the corridors ends with an exit to the roof. Be aware that there is a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Basilisk\"&gt;Lesser Basilisk&lt;/a&gt; waiting when you exit the door. Three &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Basilisk\"&gt;Greater Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s are found on the top roof level. A &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mirrored%20Eyes\"&gt;Potion of Mirrored Eyes&lt;/a&gt; may not last long enough, pending your speed and luck in battle. Since &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Petrification\"&gt;Protection From Petrification&lt;/a&gt; in its various forms lasts at minimum of 1 hour, this is the better choice.\nThe Tower Floors.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Ground%20Floor%29\"&gt;Ground Floor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you are taking &lt;a href=\"Ike\"&gt;Ike's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%20Tour%20of%20Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;guided tour&lt;/a&gt; of the tower, keep talking to him until he tries to sell you a wardstone. Whether you accept or reject it, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt; will appear and unleash a couple of &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spells on Ike, the &lt;a href=\"Tourist\"&gt;tourist's&lt;/a&gt;, and any party member located in the wrong spot and then teleport away. It is impossible to kill the Demon Knight at this point. The only floor trap on this level is in the doorway to the left of the skeleton. This is a silent trap that is only activated when one of the tourists sets it off.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Second%20Floor%29\"&gt;Second Floor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no notable NPC's on this floor though there are numerous items you can collect. The only enemies are six &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s which may be tough to defeat depending on your level. There are several floor traps too.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Third%20Floor%29\"&gt;Third Floor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two NPC's on this floor; &lt;a href=\"Daital\"&gt;Daital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riggilo\"&gt;Riggilo&lt;/a&gt;. There are no floor traps on this level, but there are numerous items you can collect including a &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Understanding\"&gt;Tome of Understanding&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaital.\nDaital is a specter who can be found in the medical room. He will mistake you for the former master of the tower and will summon an &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Stalker\"&gt;Invisible Stalker&lt;/a&gt; and cast &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; when he turns hostile. This may be a tough battle but results in 3750 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiggilo.\nIn the bedroom is Riggilo. He will talk to you upon sight. If you annoy him he will attack otherwise he'll remain neutral.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Fourth%20Floor%29\"&gt;Fourth Floor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the final floor of the tower. The only NPC is &lt;a href=\"Kirinhale\"&gt;Kirinhale&lt;/a&gt;. There are no floor traps on this level, but again there are still numerous items you can collect.\nKirinhale.\nKirinhale can be found in her room. She is desperate to escape the tower and will give you a chance to help her. You can refuse her request, in which case she will attack, or offer to help her out of her predicament. She also carries the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Spear\"&gt;Staff Spear&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Cellar%29\"&gt;Cellar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only NPC is &lt;a href=\"Bayard\"&gt;Bayard&lt;/a&gt; and the only enemies are five ghasts. There are several floor traps too. A secret door will become visible while exploring the cellar and this leads to the lower labyrinth levels beneath the tower.\nThe Lower Labyrinth Levels.\nExploring the tower's lower levels tells the story of the dwarven hero &lt;a href=\"Durlag%20Trollkiller\"&gt;Durlag Trollkiller&lt;/a&gt; and is much harder to complete than the upper floors. There are plenty of potions, ammo, coin, and nifty artifacts to obtain here, but doing so without &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Find%20/%20Disarm%20Traps\"&gt;disarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Open%20Locks\"&gt;unlock&lt;/a&gt; skills can be quite challenging. There are dozens of floor traps to locate and disarm. The vast majority of containers are trapped and locked as well.\nThis area is not for the faint of heart or those of low level. You have been warned.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20One%29\"&gt;Labyrinth Level One&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis first labyrinth level beneath the tower has one primary objective which is to solve the riddles of &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Warders\"&gt;The Four Warders&lt;/a&gt;. The level contains numerous floor traps and trapped containers. One high value item to be found is &lt;a href=\"The%20Practical%20Defense\"&gt;The Practical Defense&lt;/a&gt;, a magical set of armor originally owned by Durlag's father, Bolhur Thunderaxe. Enemies of note include &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Doppelganger\"&gt;Greater Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20Jelly\"&gt;Mustard Jelly&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Golem\"&gt;Flesh Golem&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to advance to the next level is by having the &lt;a href=\"Level%201%20Exit%20Wardstone\"&gt;Level 1 Exit Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; in your possession.\nThe Four Warders.\nThe four warders represent weaknesses of the warrior: &lt;a href=\"Avarice\"&gt;Avarice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Love\"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pride\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;. Each is a riddle that must be solved by exploring the level and performing certain actions to gain an understanding of how they relate to horrors Durlag had to face.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Two%29\"&gt;Labyrinth Level Two&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis level is where it really gets fun...and confusing. There are numerous doors, some of which are warded and require specific actions to be undertaken to open them. Magical wardstones also play an important role in the exploration of this level. Notable NPCs include Durlag and his family: &lt;a href=\"Islanne\"&gt;Islanne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fuernebol\"&gt;Fuernebol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20the%20Legion%20Killer\"&gt;Kiel the Legion Killer&lt;/a&gt;, although they may not be who you think they are. Floor traps, some of which are silent, are everywhere. Among the high value items to be found are the possessions of Kiel which include his: &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Morning%20Star\"&gt;morning star&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Buckler\"&gt;buckler&lt;/a&gt;. Ghasts and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Doom%20Guard\"&gt;Dwarven Doom Guard&lt;/a&gt;s are just some of the enemies that are encountered. The only way to advance to the next level is by having the &lt;a href=\"Level%202%20Exit%20Wardstone\"&gt;Level 2 Exit Wardstone&lt;/a&gt; in your possession.\nThe Doors.\nLocked and warded doors are found throughout and can make navigating this level quite frustrating. And by opening certain doors, others that were already opened just might close. Several different wardstones can aid in opening some of the initial doors that the party will come across and can help in easing the way forward. And once the party has reached the switch room it becomes much easier to open and close a good number of these doors.\nTraps.\nThe level contains numerous floor traps and several of them are silent. Triggering these silent traps will lead to the spawning of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Doppelganger\"&gt;Greater Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s in the guise of Durlag and his family, or even in their true doppelganger form. A long passageway contains many of these traps that, when tripped, will unleash multiple ghasts upon the party. Trapped containers are also found in many of the rooms on this level.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Three%29\"&gt;Labyrinth Level Three&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis level of the dungeon beneath the tower doesn't have many rooms but what it lacks in rooms it makes up for in the difficulty of completing the level and moving on to the next. Three initial rooms each present unique challenges that will test the party in different ways. Enemies in these different rooms include &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Wyvern\"&gt;Greater Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s that shoot magical arrows, and invisible &lt;a href=\"Ashirukuru\"&gt;Ashirukuru&lt;/a&gt;s that can kill a party member with one backstab. The level also contains four elemental challenges, each in its own separate area, which must be completed to advance to the chessboard. Floor traps are numerous. High value items include the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;Wizard Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20World%27s%20Edge\"&gt;The World's Edge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Four Elemental Challenges.\nThese four areas each contain a specific type of \"elemental\" foe that must be defeated. The four elements these foes represent include: fire (&lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Guard\"&gt;Phoenix Guard&lt;/a&gt;), ice (&lt;a href=\"Kaldran%20the%20Bear\"&gt;Kaldran the Bear&lt;/a&gt;), slime (&lt;a href=\"Fission%20Slime\"&gt;Fission Slime&lt;/a&gt;), and wind (&lt;a href=\"Air%20Aspect\"&gt;Air Aspect&lt;/a&gt;). The instant the last challenge is completed, the party will be immediately teleported to the chessboard.\nThe Chessboard.\nHere the party will find itself confronted by all the pieces of a typical chessboard. It seems that Durlag enjoyed the age old game of chess and the challenges it can present in winning the game. Killing the &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; piece will allow the party to advance to the next level of the dungeon. An ethereal voice will provide the rules of moving on it. Failing to obey said rules will lead to an electrical barrage of lightning bolts unleashed upon the transgressor(s) and everyone else on the board. On the other side is a door that leads to the next level.\n&lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Four%29\"&gt;Labyrinth Level Four&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the final dungeon level beneath the tower. The specters of Durlag and Islanne can be found on this level. He will provide you with vague clues as to what must be accomplished on this level to gain understanding about his predicament and why he still haunts this place. Islanne will provide a quick way to exit the level and return to the outside world. Exploration of this level reveals a statue that will speak to you, a room with a carpet that can make the party's journey to the afterlife a quick reality, and a huge cavern of slime filled with &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ghoul\"&gt;Greater Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. And finally, when the riddles of the compass room have been solved, a showdown with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt; will be your final task. Notable NPCs include the greater ghoul &lt;a href=\"Grael\"&gt;Grael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clair%20De%27Lain\"&gt;Clair De'Lain&lt;/a&gt;, and the young adventurer &lt;a href=\"Dalton\"&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt;, who's discovery and release will lead towards the completion of a side &lt;a href=\"Therella%27s%20Missing%20Son\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous high value items are found on this level including: &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Earth\"&gt;The Burning Earth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Striking\"&gt;Staff of Striking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pellan%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Pellan's Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krotan%27s%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Krotan's Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arla%27s%20Dragonbane\"&gt;Arla's Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karajah%27s%20Life%20and%20Death\"&gt;Karajah's Life and Death&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Shield\"&gt;Cloak of the Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Difficult enemies, besides those already mentioned, include a couple of &lt;a href=\"Helmed%20Horror\"&gt;Helmed Horror&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Phase%20Spider\"&gt;Astral Phase Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Compass Room.\nExploration of the level will reveal certain rooms which contain specific items, that when clicked on, will teleport the party to a circular room with four stone golems. The only way to leave is to correctly answer the riddle posed by one of the golems. Speaking with the other three will provide clues to the answer of each riddle. The party will be teleported here a total of three times. After the third time, speak with Durlag's specter in the hallway and he will lead the party to a warded door, which when opened, leads to the last of Durlag's many throne rooms beneath the tower.\nThe Demon Knight.\nWhen you enter this final throne room, Clair De'Lain will immediately hail the party. She will describe the horrors she and her group of fellow adventurers encountered when they attempted to confront the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Knight\"&gt;Demon Knight&lt;/a&gt;. This is the toughest of all the battles fought by the party. Be prepared for the spells cast by the evil entity and the possibility of having to fight a duplicate of every member of the party. The Demon Knight has a &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;Helmet of Opposite Alignment&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Soultaker%20Dagger\"&gt;Soultaker Dagger&lt;/a&gt; in his possession. The dagger is needed to finish the &lt;a href=\"Recovering%20%22Soultaker%22\"&gt;Recovering \"Soultaker\"&lt;/a&gt; quest. Killing the Demon Knight will complete your exploration of Durlag's Tower."}
{"id": "2604", "revid": "53032777", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2604", "title": "Durlag Trollkiller", "text": "Son of Bolhur Thunderaxe, Durlag Trollkiller was one of the most powerful dwarves of his time, and undoubtedly one of the richest. As his name suggests, he earned his fame slaying trolls and other ferocious beasts, with his small band of adventurers. After retiring from adventuring, Durlag set about building a great tower in which to begin his own clan and to prevent himself from dying alone as his father did. This tower became known throughout the land as &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Durlag's Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nLike all dwarves, Durlag was short and stocky. He was immensely strong and had bright reddish hair.\nPersonality.\nDurlag shares the personality traits of many great heroes; bravery, courage, and brilliant resourcefulness. He was also extremely stubborn.\nDuring the last few years of his life, after his tragedy, Durlag became extremely paranoid and depressed.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nDurlag completed many quests in his younger years, including slaying a vast horde of Drow, ridding the Troll Mountains of their fearsome beasts, and slaying numerous dragons single handedly, including Vissilithysmee whose flames were 'a gentle breeze' to Durlag.\nNearing his peak as a fearsome fighter, Durlag and his good friend Arlo Stoneblade, sought out and fought a terrible evil \u2018that dared to walk the earth\u2019. That evil was a tanar'ri by the name of Aec'Letec. Arlo was killed by the beast during the fight, but Durlag was able to slay the demon and he captured its soul in the &lt;a href=\"Soultaker%20Dagger\"&gt;Soultaker Dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilding Durlag's Tower.\nAt a certain point Durlag decided to put his adventuring days behind him and began his own dwarven clan with another of his fellow dwarven adventurer\u2019s, Islanne. The couple married and Durlag began building a huge fortress in the mountains. The entire building was carved from volcanic rock so as to make it impregnable. It was here that Durlag would start raising his own family. He wanted to be able to live out the rest of his life in peace, surrounded by his kin, content in the knowledge that they would be safe.\nAfter slaying so many foul beasts and traveling to lands both near and far, Durlag had accumulated a vast amount of wealth and treasure. He hired fellow dwarves to help him build the tower and dig the chambers and passageways below it. The fortune occupied entire rooms throughout the fortress with stacks of coins and gems rumored to be waist deep on a man.\nThe Fall of Durlag.\nHowever, not long into Durlag's new life, great tragedy befell upon him. As the stories of his opulence spread across the land, the most unsavory of creatures \u2013 foul &lt;a href=\"mind%20flayers\"&gt;mind flayers&lt;/a&gt;, who felt that the tower encroached upon their turf, wanted the tower and wealth for themselves. The tower was built to withstand any siege so Durlag's enemies had to find more sinister ways to penetrate it.\nIn secret, Durlag's family and friends were assassinated one by one and replaced by doppelgangers, until eventually Durlag discovered the deception, but it was too late. The rest then began attacking him, as one by one Durlag's family seemingly turned on him in his own home. He was forced to slay his wife and two sons to stay alive.\nDurlag's outstanding courage and strength allowed him to kill all but two of the invaders of his home, but it was at a great price. Not only had he lost his family; he also lost his mind.\nAfter laying each fallen member of his family to rest in ornate burial chambers deep underneath the tower, Durlag vowed that no other force would ever disturb his tower again. Afraid that the illithids would return, and deeply suspicious that the folks of Faer\u00fbn might seek to betray him for his fortune, Durlag went about hiring the best builders and craftsman from nearby towns to rebuild the tower and the levels below it. The tower was laden with complex contraptions to punish intruders in the most horrific ways. It has been speculated that the building was the most dangerous and secure building in all of Faer\u00fbn.\nMany of the lower levels and the rooms therein were protected by powerful, magically held doors and could only be accessed with the correct wardstones. The tower was filled with all manner of rare and magical items that Durlag had obtained during his travels. Many of these artifacts were secreted away in rooms and containers that were protected by complex traps and charms.\nHe then retreated to the inner-most sanctums and waited. Many brave and greedy explorers tried to disarm the defenses and steal Durlag's wealth; every time they would fail. Durlag would watch through magic portals or other devices as adventurer after adventurer attempted to breach his home. It's said that he would sometimes crawl up secret tunnels and slay the opportunists himself.\nHe carried on in this increasingly eccentric manner for several hundred years, never once leaving the tower, surviving on fungi and mushrooms growing in the deepest &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Two%29\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt; below the tower and, it is cruelly whispered, the bodies of intruders (unsubstantiated rumor according to some). He eventually passed away on his own, as he had always feared. The great Durlag Trollkiller spent his final years alone, paranoid and tormented by the unfathomable events of his past.\nInteractions.\nMultiple &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Doppelganger\"&gt;Greater Doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;s in Durlag's form can be found on &lt;a href=\"Durlag%27s%20Tower%20%28Labyrinth%20Level%20Two%29\"&gt;labyrinth level 2&lt;/a&gt; beneath the tower and must be slain repeatedly by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and party.\nThe total number of Durlag's encountered is dependent upon the initial forms taken by the two randomly generated doppelgangers that are spawned when triggering silent traps located in certain places on this level. So it is possible to confront up to a total of four Durlag's.\nThe First Three Rooms.\n\"Note: Go to the Labyrinth Level 2 area page for a complete description of the Doors on this level.\"\nEntering the practice room and attacking the gold sparring dummy will activate two warded doors (referred to as Doors 4 &amp; 5). Durlag will appear in the passageway between the doors and begin his lament for Fuernebol while teleporting into and around the room. When he finishes his dialogue, he\u2019ll cast &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and immediately revert to his true greater doppelganger form.\nEntering Islanne's room and removing Islanne's wardstone from the table on which is is found will active two warded doors (Doors 6 &amp; 7). Durlag will appear in the passageway between the doors and begin his lament for Islanne while teleporting into and around the room. When he finishes his dialogue, he\u2019ll cast &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and immediately revert to his true greater doppelganger form.\nEntering the throne room through Door 3 and picking up &lt;a href=\"Kiel%27s%20Helmet\"&gt;Kiel's Helmet&lt;/a&gt; will bring forth the final Durlag for this segment of the dungeon. Durlag will appear in the circular antechamber and teleport through the passageway into the room. He will then begin his lament for Kiel while teleporting around the room. Doppelganger forms of Fuernebol and Islanne will also enter the room at this time from Doors 8 and 9 respectively. Once he finishes with his dialogue, all three will cast spells; Durlag and Fuernebol will cast &lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and Islanne will cast &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;. They will then immediately shapeshift into their true greater doppelganger forms, cast &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, and attack.\nRandom Encounter.\nWhen the silent traps are triggered while exploring this level, two greater doppelgangers will spawn nearby, but out of sight. It is possible that one of the two will be in Durlag's form. \nOnce fighting begins, he will attack with his axe while maintaining his own form. But once he begins to receive damage, he may first shapeshift into Islanne's form, and then with additional damage taken, shapeshift into Kiel's form.

What a regular dwarf lacks in in height (measuring between 4 and 5 feet), he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts.\nDwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also have dense bodies and are difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, with little ill effect.\nMale dwarves are often bald and grow thick facial hair, which is sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grow ample facial hair, though the majority of shield dwarf females shave their beards off.\nMany dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities.\nSubraces.\nDuergar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duergar\"&gt;Duergar&lt;/a&gt;, also known as gray dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves. They carve out an existence in the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;. Their kinship to surface dwarves can be compared to that of the &lt;a href=\"Drow\"&gt;Drow&lt;/a&gt; to surface &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; folk. Duergar are implemented in the game.\nGold Dwarf.\nGold dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves, and are known for their confidence and keen intuition. The culture of their Deep Kingdom values family, ritual, and fine craftmanship. These are not implemented in the game.\nShield Dwarf.\nShield Dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves, survived a long fall from grace, surrendering many of their ancient kingdoms in wars with goblins and orcs. These losses have lead to a cynical mindset, yet shield dwarves will endure anything to restore their ancestral homelands. These are not implemented in the game.\nClasses.\nClass Accessibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;\nMulti-Class Accessibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Cleric&lt;/a&gt;\nDwarves make excellent warriors because of their extremely high constitution. The very small selection of playable classes available for dwarves, second only to &lt;a href=\"halfling\"&gt;halfling&lt;/a&gt;s, may discourage anyone wanting to play a dwarf that isn't the fighting type. They don't have as much strength as &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s, but their ungodly high saving throws more than makes up for it in the long run. While the 17 maximum in dexterity at character creation hurts their armor class, it can be boosted to 18 with the use of skill manuals. This will put your &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; on par with any other race outside of halflings and &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarves are also the only race who can play as the fighter kit &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Defender\"&gt;Dwarven Defender&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only class kit that is not available to &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.\nThose interested in playing &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; can still do so with a dwarf character because the dexterity restriction is actually balanced out by naturally high racial adjustments to thieving skills (particularly disarm traps, open locks and set traps). However, it should be noted that the high constitution bonus only applies to warrior classes and the steep charisma penalty dwarves suffer doesn't make them ideal as party leaders or for getting the best prices at stores.\nIn-Game Depiction.\nThe games lack a female sprite for the dwarven race. As such, there is no visual difference between female and male dwarves.\nRelated Items.\nExclusive item: &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Thrower\"&gt;Dwarven Thrower&lt;/a&gt; \nNot exclusive items but better for Dwarves :"}

The goal of this quest is to rescue a group of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s from an infestation of undead in the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Dig%20Site\"&gt;Dwarven Dig Site&lt;/a&gt;, and then determine how to deal with darker secrets dwelling below.\nWalkthrough.\nSaving Semahl.\nTraveling directly north at the first opportunity, the party will encounter the giant &lt;a href=\"Semahl\"&gt;Semahl&lt;/a&gt; under attack by a &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Wight\"&gt;Cold Wight&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Wight\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaving him from death and not triggering a combat in the following conversation will earn the party .\nExploring the Dwarven Dig Site.\nOnce past the entrance of dig, the mine splits vertically into four corridors and the locations of note are:\nExploring the Repository of Undeath.\nThere are many undead in the repository, plan accordingly. Collect three scepters throughout the dungeon and the white potion.\u00a0\u00a0These are placed in the &lt;a href=\"Repository%20of%20Undeath%23Scrying%20Pool\"&gt;large pool near the beginning of the level&lt;/a&gt;. You may then watch three cut scenes giving you more backstory on three different characters.\u00a0Doing so awards to each party member for each cutscene.\nThere are at least two rooms to\u00a0the northeast with quite a few undead. Be ready with AOE firebombs, slow spells, etc.\u00a0\nThe last room to the north has four pillars with a plaque describing different seasons (from left to right: autumn [cracked leaf], spring [leaf], winter [snowflake], summer [shining sun]). Interact with each of the pillars twice in this order: winter (3), autumn (1), summer (4), spring (2). If you press one of the plaques out of order, some &lt;a href=\"Mephit\"&gt;mephits&lt;/a&gt; will spawn (lightning, earth, cold or fire) and the puzzle will reset.\u00a0\nSuccessfully solving the puzzle opens the nearby door to find Gurn Coldhearth.\u00a0\nPerhaps sensing his own vulnerability as a freshly-born lich, Gurn Coldhearth is surprisingly open to conversation. As long as you do not directly threaten him in dialogue, he will ask you to bring him the five &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Keeper%20of%20Secrets%20Under%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Amulets of the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; from the dwarves in the dig site above, and promises an item of great power. If you already have at least one of these amulets but not all five, do NOT show it to him, as he will say you're trying to cheat him and attack. Agreeing to help him will not commit you to any particular path.\nIf you detect the secret door on the north side of his chamber, &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Open_Locks\"&gt;pick the lock&lt;/a&gt;, and open it, Gurn will immediately turn hostile towards you, so you may wish to avoid this unless you are prepared to fight him.\nAt this point, you have a choice to make in how to proceed.\nSiding with Gurn Coldhearth.\nShould you decide to side with Gurn, the most straightforward way to complete the quest is to return to the Dwarven Dig Site and kill Brother Deepvein and his fellow dwarven clerics. If you saved Semahl earlier you will have to fight him as well. Likewise if you informed Daran Highhammer that his employers were still alive inside he will join the battle.\nKilling them is easier said than done, as a group of this many divine casters at once is a force to be reckoned with, with many buffs, debuffs and even damaging spells flying around at once. After they are dead, search through their possessions for three of the amulets (dropped by Deepvein and two of the unnamed clerics).\nAlternatively, a may &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities%23Pick%20Pockets\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; the amulets from the dwarves to avoid a fight and also keep your options open for who to assist in this quest.\nThe other two amulets are easy to find on your first visit to the dig site and it is likely you will already have them. One is found on the ground near Brother Deepvein and the other is in the far southeastern room (an encounter with umber hulks).\nReturn to Gurn and give him the amulets. Your potential rewards are heavily influenced by your dialogue choices here:\nSiding with the dwarven clerics.\nShould you decide to side with Deepvein and the clerics, return to them up at the dig site and tell Brother Deepvein the truth about Gurn. Deepvein will need to be convinced that his friend has betrayed him and become a creature of darkness.\nIf Brother Deepvein is convinced he will ask for your help in destroying his former friend and will give you &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Revealed%20%28item%29\"&gt;The Secret Revealed&lt;/a&gt;, a usable gem that is specifically designed to weaken liches. You may use it three times before its power is depleted, but Deepvein can recharge it for you twice more before it's unusable. However, you will not be able to recharge it while Gurn is still a threat, as a wall of force will prevent you from leaving the Repository of Undeath as long as he is hostile to you. The battle will be to the death.\nReturn to the Repository of Undeath to confront Gurn Coldhearth.\nGurn is an extremely powerful combatant, with access to many spells your party will not be able to cast until well into , spells you will never have even seen before at this stage of the game. He will cast &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; triggering &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;. He also has a regular &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt; set up that will trigger &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;. He can cast 9th level spells such as &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, and many other powerful spells such as &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to kill him without any special advantages, but the battle is much easier with the use of &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Revealed%20%28item%29\"&gt;The Secret Revealed&lt;/a&gt;, which permanently removes many of his immunities and resistances, dispels any protections he has up, causes him to &lt;a href=\"Miscast%20Magic\"&gt;miscast magic&lt;/a&gt; and deals a bit of damage (see &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Revealed%20%28spell%29\"&gt;The Secret Revealed (spell)&lt;/a&gt; for details). You should be able to kill Gurn with the help of only one or two uses.\nThe moment Gurn dies, you have about one minute of real time to find and destroy &lt;a href=\"Coldhearth%20Phylactery\"&gt;his phylactery&lt;/a&gt; before he revives again at full strength and &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;teleports&lt;/a&gt; to your location in the Repository of Undeath. As such you will need to hurry through the following steps.\nWhen Gurn is killed he will drop the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Key\"&gt;Ancient Key&lt;/a&gt; which will open the secret door on the north side of his chamber (if your thief has not already &lt;a href=\"Thief%23Open_Locks\"&gt;picked the lock&lt;/a&gt;). At the end of the long hallway is a chamber with six phylacteries. Interacting twice with the fourth from the left will get you two &lt;a href=\"Black%20Opal\"&gt;Black Opal&lt;/a&gt;s, and the fifth from the left will get you a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. The rest drop nothing, except Gurn's which is the second from the left. Interact with it twice to remove it.\nNext you will need to destroy the phylactery, which can only be done using the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Elemental Plane of Fire&lt;/a&gt; (where the box was forged), conveniently accessible via the magic circle on the far west side of the Repository of Undeath. You may have an easier time doing this before Gurn rematerializes if you use one character as a dedicated runner, especially with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;The Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; equipped and/or &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; cast. Make your way to the circle as quickly as you can. It is likely that more fire-based monsters will have appeared within the circle since you last visited, but it is possible to ignore them momentarily for the real purpose you are here. Interact with the center of the circle to cast the golden box into the flames, destroying the lich Gurn Coldhearth once and for all. For doing so you will earn 3000 quest &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; for each party member, an &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Tears\"&gt;King's Tears&lt;/a&gt;, , and an additional 22,000 &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to Brother Deepvein and let him know that Coldhearth is no more. He will reward you with a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Restoration\"&gt;Greater Restoration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Dumathoin\"&gt;Helmet of Dumathoin&lt;/a&gt;. You will also have an opportunity to ask for his aid in the upcoming battle against Caelar Argent, and he will promise it without hesitation. If you do not ask for his help against Caelar and &lt;a href=\"Schael%20Corwin\"&gt;Schael Corwin&lt;/a&gt; is in the party, she will ask anyway and receive the same promise.\nAfterward as long as you are not rude to Brother Deepvein, he will offer his services as a healer to the party.\nSiding with both.\nIt is possible to receive multiple rewards from this quest by pickpocketing the amulets in the dwarves' possession and giving them to Gurn in exchange for the Dread Hammer +2, then killing him and reporting his death for the remaining quest rewards. This is useful as he does not drop the hammer upon death.\nMore tactically speaking, your party will have a much easier time fighting the lich if they don't openly declare their intention to do so at the door."}

She's also the only Invoker in games, a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;specialist mage&lt;/a&gt; who gains one extra spell per spell level, but unable to master some late game shiners - enchantment spells like &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;.

I shall not force myself where I am not wanted.\"\nRecruitment.\nDynaheir is available to recruit from Chapter 7 . She is found alongside with Minsc on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Three%20Old%20Kegs\"&gt;Three Old Kegs&lt;/a&gt;, after a short catch-up, they'll join your march towards the &lt;a href=\"Dragonspear%20Castle\"&gt;Dragonspear Castle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt;'s crusades, and like in BG1, She has to pair with Minsc.\nQuests.\nNear the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20River\"&gt;Underground River&lt;/a&gt; caverns, you'll meet &lt;a href=\"Julann\"&gt;Julann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rigah\"&gt;Rigah&lt;/a&gt;, a Wychalarn and a knight who are also on dejemma from &lt;a href=\"Rashemen\"&gt;Rashemen&lt;/a&gt;, they're considering joining the crusade. You have the following ways to deal with them:\nBeware, companions in SoD will still leave you if the party's reputation becomes too high or too low and ways of lowering reputation in SoD are both limited and miss-able.\nQuotes.\nAt some point while journeying with Minsc and potentially others, they were captured, imprisoned, and tortured by agents of &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;. While Minsc survived the confines of the dungeon where the player first finds themselves, it would seem that Dynaheir died at some point prior to this, perhaps during the initial confrontation.\nPersonality.\nDynaheir is the epitome of her alignment, often finding her actions to be righteous, while being critical of those who don't stack up. Her most unique characteristic would be that she exhibits a strange speech pattern, using the possessive instead of normal early modern pronouns; 'thy' instead of 'thee' or 'thou'. For example, \"Whatever thy need\" does make sense as \"whatever your need is\", but seeing as she also says \"Thy called?\" instead of \"Thou called\", it's probably is supposed to mean \"whatever you have need of\"."}

They are usually only found on the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Material%20Plane\"&gt;Material Plane&lt;/a&gt; or other worlds after being summoned by &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; or other spellcasters. This page deals with the summoned and most unsummoned versions. There are &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Lesser Earth Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, Earth Elementals and Greater Earth Elementals. See for more.\nDescription.\nEarth Elementals are hulking creatures composed entirely of the stone, earth and even minerals of the area in which they are summoned. They have large, hunched upper bodies with powerful arms and spikes protruding from their backs. The lesser variety is roughly between a human and a dwarf in height (but considerably stockier and bulkier than both), while the standard earth elemental is larger than even an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and as wide as a wagon.\nSummoning.\nThere's very little difference between the two versions of the spell: the wizard has to battle for control over the elemental, whereas the priest does not. Stats for both summoned creatures are the same.\nStatistics.\nThe infobox lists the common, 10 to 12 Hit Dice (HD) version. The many versions have slight variable stats, and attribute values. The game files have inconsistent naming conventions, where Lesser Earth Elementals are just titled \"Earth Elemental\", and the 16 and 24 HD versions aren't called Greater Earth Elementals, but just Earth Elemental. At the same time there are also named versions that are titled Lesser and Greater. It is quite the jumble of naming conventions, and the developers lost track of the differences between the lesser, ordinary, greater and even summoned varieties of elementals. \nEarth Elementals, including Lesser to Greater types can have strength attributes ranging from 13, 17, 19, 20, all the way to 22 in the game files. For a 10 to 12 HD version, the average strength rating will be 19. \nIn addition to the listed statistics, earth elementals have immunity to normal weapons and +1 enchanted weapons. They can inflict 4d8 crushing damage using a +4 enchanted melee weapon fist attack, but only get one attack per round. This is usually achieved by equipping the undroppable items &lt;a href=\"IMMUNE2.ITM\"&gt;IMMUNE2.ITM&lt;/a&gt; as a ring, and the &lt;a href=\"B4-32M4.ITM\"&gt;B4-32M4.ITM&lt;/a&gt; as a melee quick weapon. There is also a ELEAR.ITM for the Underdark 10 HD \"Earth Gate\" Elementals, but it is identical to the B4-32M attack.\nMod Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; makes minor revisions to all earth elementals in the game. It provides them with immunity to &lt;a href=\"Paralyze\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Entangle\"&gt;Entangle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; effects. \nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod provides altered and reworked conjured elementals in the game. These elementals are actually more powerful in most ways than the unmodded game. Any Elementals conjured by Priest/Druid or Wizard Spells by friend or foe will have the revised powers, immunities and stats. A summary of the 12 and 16 HD Spell revision Earth Elementals summoned forth by the &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Conjure Earth Elemental&lt;/a&gt; spell is detailed below:&lt;br&gt;\nEarth Elemental (12 Hit Dice):&lt;br&gt;\nSTR 21, DEX 8, CON 19, INT 6, WIS 11, CHA 11; AL Neutral&lt;br&gt;\nHP 126, AC 3, THAC0 4, Saving Throws 7/9/8/8/10&lt;br&gt;\n2 Attacks Per Round, 2d8+12 Crushing Damage (Fist +3)&lt;br&gt;\nGreater Earth Elemental (16 Hit Dice):&lt;br&gt;\nSTR 23, DEX 8, CON 21, INT 6, WIS 11, CHA 11; AL Neutral&lt;br&gt;\nHP 152, AC 2, THAC0 0, Saving Throws 4/6/5/4/7&lt;br&gt;\n2 Attacks Per Round, 2d10+14 Crushing Damage (Fist +3)&lt;br&gt;\nSpecial Qualities (12 &amp; 16 Hit Dice):&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to normal weapons&lt;br&gt;\nImmune to hold, poison, polymorph, sleep, &amp; stun effects&lt;br&gt;\nSlashing, Piercing, &amp; Missile Resistance 40%"}

It also has the innate &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Spit\"&gt;Stone Spit&lt;/a&gt; ability. \nThe mephit will initiate the \"Stone Spit\" attack, which launches a stone bullet at a target in range and it deals 1d6 damage. The unmodified game Earth Mephit can only attempt this innate ability attack every 5 rounds after the initial launch, meaning that it will likely be dead well before its second attempt. A Mephit is really only a threat in large numbers.\nThe Earth Mephit have no magic, physical damage or elemental resistance. The InfoBox summarizes their special abilities and immunities to certain status effects. The game has the creature with a memorized &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; spell but it isn't scripted to use it, so it is probably just a developer creature file copy-paste remnant."}

All creatures within the area of effect are exposed to the tremors and cracks, friend or foe.\nGameplay.\nThe spell exposes all creatures to a potential Sleep effect (Opcode #39) meant to emulate an &lt;a href=\"unconscious\"&gt;unconscious&lt;/a&gt; effect lasting 4 rounds. A saving throw vs. spells with a -6 penalty will negate. The effect can be blocked by magic resistance. A creature made unconscious will not reawaken by suffering damage. Elves and Half Elves do not gain any protection against this effect based on their racial &lt;a href=\"Sleep%20%28Status%20Effect%29\"&gt;Sleep (Status Effect)&lt;/a&gt; resistance, but sleep effect (Opcode #39) immunities do work (eg most &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Familiars&lt;/a&gt; are immune to it, &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt; protects against it and so does &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt;).\nContrary to what one might expect, the earthquake effects don't really act over the targeted area and, instead, are applied to each of the creatures who were there at the time of casting. This means that it's safe to enter the targeted area after the spell is cast and creatures who leave it will still suffer subsequent tremors.\nThe Earthquake itself applies &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20damage\"&gt;Crushing damage&lt;/a&gt; and, as a kind of &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, it can be mitigated by a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn relation to the angry elemental that can spawn when casting this spell (2% chance), there are a few things to know:\nThe Earth Elemental prince &lt;a href=\"Ogremoch\"&gt;Ogremoch&lt;/a&gt; is scripted to force cast a party-friendly version of this spell (so it will only affect the player's party) during combat in &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Diaytha%20Abishai\"&gt;Sendai's Lair (Diaytha)&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Sunnis\"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Prince of Earth that the player can summon via &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Summoning\"&gt;Elemental Summoning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Elemental%20Summoning\"&gt;Greater Elemental Summoning&lt;/a&gt;, can cast the exact same party-friendly version of this spell (but, in this case, only affecting enemies). In both cases, the 2% chance to spawn an angry elemental remains and, just like the regular spell, said creature will be aligned against the caster (so Ogremoch has a small chance of producing an ally for the player).\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this divine spell, revising its effects, saving throw, spell level and description. See below:\nEarthquake\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Alteration\nSphere: Elemental (Earth)\nRange: Long\nDuration: 3 rounds\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: 30\u2019 radius\nSaving Throw: Special\nWhen this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips the ground. Once every round for the spell\u2019s duration, a tremor will take place, affecting all creatures in its area of effect. Earth elementals and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell.\nThere are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. paralyzation at -6 for half damage). Those who fail their saving throw fall to the ground unconscious for 2 rounds. The second tremor is less severe, causing 4d6 points of damage (save vs. death at -4 for half), but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth, which all affected creatures have a 20% chance to fall into and die (save vs. breath at -4 negates). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save vs. death at -2 for half) and there is a 10% chance affected creatures will be trapped within the fissures, causing death (save vs. breath at -2 negates). Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to try to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.\nThis spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell."}

You'll see him storming east of the army camp at &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Way%20Crossing\"&gt;Coast Way Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, angrily mumbling about &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar&lt;/a&gt;, you can convince him to join the party once he sees that you share the same goal.\nRelated quests.\nEdwin wants you to kill &lt;a href=\"Vichand\"&gt;Vichand&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow red wizard of &lt;a href=\"Thay\"&gt;Thay&lt;/a&gt; who joined the crusade. Vichand can be found in crusader camp at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Boareskyr%20Bridge\"&gt;Boareskyr Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. In order for the quest to complete, Edwin needs to see his corpse in in the aforementioned area Boareskyr Bridge (BD2000). This means that if you resolve the siege situation without Edwin in your party, you will afterwards never be able to get him to acknowledge the kill (expressed without dialog but just the string \"Vichand is dead! Such is the fate of any enemy of Edwin!\"). 3 hours after that acknowledgement, Edwin will reward you with a &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Red%20Flames\"&gt;Robe of Red Flames&lt;/a&gt;, which can be &lt;a href=\"Importing%20a%20Character%23Siege%20of%20Dragonspear%20Items\"&gt;imported&lt;/a&gt; into.\n&amp;.\nRecruitment.\nEdwin is available from &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;. He can be recruited in Mae'var's Guildhall during &lt;a href=\"Find%20proof%20of%20Mae%27var%27s%20Treachery\"&gt;Find proof of Mae'var's Treachery&lt;/a&gt;, which potentially leads to obtaining the thief &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. If you \"underestimate his importance\", he offers the choice to be right where you left him or at the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Enhanced Edition he will be level 9, Trained in Dagger and Quarterstaff.\nGameplay.\n&lt;a href=\"Edwin%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;His family amulet&lt;/a&gt; now gives him \"two\" additional spells per level instead of one in BG1, the total bonus for him would be three extra spells per spell level as he's also a &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score of 18 allows him to scribe level 9 spells without an &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; modification. His main drawback is not accessing to which is a minor issue for the game offers plenty of other ways of casting &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;. Another drawback is that his amulet, while powerful, prevents him from wearing the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;, making him unable to benefit from the maximum casting time reduction of 5 by stacking it with the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Vecna\"&gt;Robe of Vecna&lt;/a&gt;, although many players consider this to be worth the price.\nConsidering the overall power\u00a0of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; spell pool, especially some \"law-defining\" spells like &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, his unique +3 spells/level pushes him to a much higher ground once high level spell slots are unlocked while others are inevitably restricted by the limited numbers of castings.\nOn top of all that, Edwin gets a -1 bonus to his saving throws after obtaining the Nether Scroll in his personal quest.\nAchievements.\nThe Nether Scroll.\nHelp Edwin &lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Nether%20Scroll%20for%20Edwin\"&gt;track down the Nether Scroll&lt;/a&gt;."}

For more information on that, see the Links below. I had a lot of fun writing this mod - if it gives you, the player, even a fraction of that pleasure, I will be content.\nAn additional optional component for the romance is a new epilogue for romanced and redeemed Viconia, of a less tragic kind than the original one. Note that this will in no way affect the Edwin romance in itself, so if you prefer Viconia's original epilogue, simply bypass this component upon installation.\nViconia.\nViconia's romance epilogue is quite controversial amongst the fandom, who argue there are multiple reasons why it breaks suspension of disbelief (such as the sheer power and mystical options available to two such high-level adventurers).\nIn this unofficial, fan-made epilogue, which only triggers if Viconia's romance is completed, Gorion's Ward convinces her to change her alignment to True Neutral, and Gorion's Ward forsakes godhood; the couple come to a happier ending. Lolth's agents begin trying to assassinate Viconia after the two are wed, and this leads to the two embarking upon an epic quest through the Underdark and the Planes to confront the Demon Queen of Spiders. While what happens remains a secret to the two of them and their friends &amp; family, Lolth's assassination attempts cease. Viconia goes on to bear at least one child to Gorion's Ward, their firstborn being a half-drow daughter who goes on to become a mighty adventurer in her own right.\nMod Links.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/SpellholdStudios/Edwin_Romance\"&gt;Mod readme on the Spellhold Studios Github&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/SpellholdStudios/Edwin_Romance/releases\"&gt;Latest Mod Version Download at Github&lt;/a&gt;"}

If the Ward agrees to help him, Edwin will join the party. It is entirely possibly to recruit both Edwin and &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;, and thus have this quest and &lt;a href=\"Rescuing%20Dynaheir\"&gt;Rescuing Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; active at the same time, but only one of the two can be completed successfully.\nIf Gorion's Ward turns down Edwin's offer, he will leave and cannot be spoken to again.\nThe stronghold itself is home to respawning groups of &lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt;. The timer for their respawn is quite short, so you may have to both fight your way in and out. The gnolls have driven whole tree sections (&lt;a href=\"pilings\"&gt;pilings&lt;/a&gt;) of appropriate lengths into the ground to make crude but effective stair steps down into the prisoner pits. &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; is at 2470, 1400, at the bottom of one of the prison pits. Note that &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; can't actually be seen without fully descending into the pit, this can be confusing because standing with the party above the pits does give the false impression that the whole pit, including the very bottom, is seen but in fact it isn't. Not reviewing in depth the prison pit can give the impression that &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; is nowhere to be found. Since she was kept in harsh conditions during her imprisonment, she is below her maximum HP when found.\nEven if you have Edwin in your party when finding Dynaheir, you can still chose if you want to kill her, rescue her or let Edwin and Dynaheir fight each other on their own.

It has several fire-based abilities, and will use its melee weapon, making it a potentially dangerous opponent if unprotected from fire, or a party member that is likely to get struck by melee attacks.\nGameplay.\nThe Efreeti is a hostile creature who is likely to attack with fire-based spells and its own melee attack. It can also turn invisible and may do so even while under its Red Fireshield. In the unmodded game, the Efreeti noble has a very simple AI script, that really only accounts for a few offensive and defensive options. It will cast &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;. It will cast &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; on self in between spell casts. The creature will be able to heal itself if exposed to fire damage. Its own Fireball could return some lost hit points if in the Area of Effect. It will also attack with its melee weapon. The creature really does not do anything else and has no ability to recognize if a party member is protected from fire or melee attacks. It is very limited in its tactics, and not too adaptable. The creature has no real defense against melee attacks and magic attacks. \nThis creature's melee attack weapon is an ordinary &lt;a href=\"Scimitar\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt;. It can inflict 1d8 slashing damage, and additional strength modifier damage applies. The game gave the creature 2 pips proficiency with blunt weapons, and nothing else, so that will not apply to the scimitar. \nSummoned Efreeti.\nThese type of efreeti will most likely only be encountered if a hostile mage casts a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Efreeti\"&gt;Summon Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; spell, or if the party does.\nWhile some efreet may have traveled to the Prime Material Plane themselves, or have been brought by other means (such as extra-planar portals), they may also be summoned; either by a &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; casting the 7th level spell &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Efreeti\"&gt;Summon Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; or by anyone capable of utilizing an &lt;a href=\"Efreeti%20Bottle\"&gt;Efreeti Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. For summons, gender is \"Summoned\" rather than Neither.\nSpell.\nEfreet summoned by spell do more melee damage than those traveling the planes themselves (3d8 +8 (&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;str&lt;/a&gt;), but have higher saving throws, possibly because they are more vulnerable, having only a partial/temporary presence in the prime plane. In all other ways they are virtually identical to non-summoned efreet. This one has legs, the same as non-summoned, because they are not tied to a &lt;a href=\"magical%20item\"&gt;magical item&lt;/a&gt;. A summoned Efreeti from a hostile mage will behave according to the creature's script, which is the same one as the unsummoned efreeti. It will use the same spells. It will have a different melee attack.\nA party summoned efreeti from the wizard spell will be a controlled creature. You will need to direct it and move it and select which spells to cast, and what to target. The selectable spells available are:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThese spells are different than what the AI scripted efreet get access to.\nEfreeti Bottle.\nThe Efreeti Bottle contains yet another version that is higher in level (10 instead of 5), but has the same 80 hit points. This one inflicts less melee damage (2d8 instead of 3d8), and does not have the spells &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the same saving throws as one summoned by spell. This version does not have legs, but rather hovers in midair, its lower body trailing off into the infinity point, as if it is being sucked back down into its bottle.\nThe Efreeti Bottle summoned creature is under your will, and a controlled creature. You will need to direct it and move it and select which spells to cast, and what to target. The selectable spells available are:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stinking%20Cloud\"&gt;Stinking Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Armor\"&gt;Ghost Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises the Efreeti. it does this by implementing the \"Smarter Genie\" component. From the Mod's Readme:\nSmarter Genies (BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component improves the various genies (djinni, efreet, and the like) in BG2. Mostly this is done by improving their scripts and systematising the rather chaotic list of spells and abilities that different genies get (in the original game, if you charmed a genie you'd see that it had a totally different list of spells from the ones it was actually using!) However, the component also changes summoned genies so that they count as \"Gated\" rather than \"Summoned\"; the practical consequence of this is that they are immune to Death Spell. This makes genie-summoning rather more useful.&lt;br&gt;\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:&lt;br&gt;\nBASIC: Genies will attack fairly unintelligently, and mostly do not use their invisibility or protective powers.&lt;br&gt;\nIMPROVED: Genies attack intelligently and use all of their magical powers.&lt;br&gt;\nTACTICAL: Genies can use their magical powers instantly and without risk of spell failure.&lt;br&gt;\nHARDCORE and above: Genies receive a modest (+50%) boost to their hit points.&lt;br&gt;\nThe summoned Efreeti have some revised powers and abilities. The 5 Hit Dice version is not used (no Efreeti has 5 HD in D&amp;D) and the 10 HD version is also changed. The wizard spell summoned Efreeti and the Efreeti Bottle summoned Efreeti are now mostly identical. Only the melee weapons differ. The AI scripts and abilities/spells/statistics are the same. They are now both 12 Hit Dice Creatures with level 12/12 Mage/Cleric spell casting levels. By script they cast wizard and priest spells (sometimes instantly depending on game difficulty selection). The creature will turn into mist form (and it is impervious to damage while in that form) and rapidly regenerate hit points when damaged over 50%. Careful timing and delivered damage can overcome the mist regeneration phase - if it isn't done correctly, the creature can take a long time to kill, as it is constantly going into mist form, regenerating, and then reforming etc.&lt;br&gt;\nThe spells available to the Efreeti are slightly different than the base game. The SCS AI is very smart and detailed, and all memorized spells can be cast. The creature responds to the party's protections in an intelligent manner. The Efreeti is healed by fire damage.&lt;br&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nAdditionally, SCS Efreeti can apply, at will and as many times as they wish an innate &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;. If dispelled or breached, it will just be renewed seconds later.\nUp to three times per battle the Efreeti can turn into gaseous form (which is immune to damage) and regenerate rapidly, then reform fully healed.\nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, all of Efreeti's memorized spells will be the SR version.\nAlso with SR, the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Efreeti\"&gt;Summon Efreeti&lt;/a&gt; wizard spell is changed. That revised spell summons a completely different version of a gated Efreeti. See the link for description of the spell and creature. Note that if SCS and SR are both installed, the SR Efreeti version is the one that appears, but it has the SCS AI assigned to it. Both mods work together by design.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Afaaq%20the%20Djinni%20Companion\"&gt;Afaaq the Djinni Companion&lt;/a&gt; mod introduced its own mod-only Efreeti, that are also different than displayed on this page, generally with more spells available with a variety of 1st through 7th level Wizard spells memorized. These various Efreeti have dialogue and are part of the story/challenge/questline. "}

This makes genie-summoning rather more useful.&lt;br&gt;\nThis component is sensitive to the difficulty setting:&lt;br&gt;\nBASIC: Genies will attack fairly unintelligently, and mostly do not use their invisibility or protective powers.&lt;br&gt;\nIMPROVED: Genies attack intelligently and use all of their magical powers.&lt;br&gt;\nTACTICAL: Genies can use their magical powers instantly and without risk of spell failure.&lt;br&gt;\nHARDCORE and above: Genies receive a modest (+50%) boost to their hit points.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Efreeti has some revised powers and abilities. They are 14 Hit Dice Creatures with level 14/14 Mage/Cleric spell casting levels with up to 156 HP. By script they cast wizard and priest spells (sometimes instantly depending on game difficulty selection). The creature will turn into mist form (and it is impervious to damage while in that form) and rapidly regenerate hit points when damaged over 50%. Careful timing and delivered damage can overcome the mist regeneration phase - if it isn't done correctly, the creature can take a long time to kill, as it is constantly going into mist form, regenerating, and then reforming etc. The spells available to the Efreeti are slightly different than the base game. The SCS AI is very smart and detailed, and all memorized spells can be cast. The creature responds to the party's protections in an intelligent manner. The Efreeti Noble is healed by fire damage, and thus will often remain within its cast &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; area of effect.&lt;br&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;\nAdditionally, SCS Efreeti can apply, at will and as many times as they wish an innate &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt;. If dispelled or breached, it will just be renewed seconds later.\nUp to three times per battle the Efreeti can turn into gaseous form (which is immune to damage) and regenerate rapidly, then reform partially or fully healed.\nWith the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod, all of Efreeti Noble's memorized spells will be the SR version."}

Though some have lost the function of various eyestalks (at least in the creature lore), they also have more hit points than ordinary beholders and are usually able to cast spells, but not always. These monsters can also employ their central eye's &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elder Orbs encountered in the game have varied AI scripts that do different things. There are some differences in behavior from every area where they may be encountered. Some have limited eye stalk use, some don't cast spells at all, some do everything - casting spells and using all their eye stalks.\nGameplay.\nElder Orb in the Planar Sphere.\nOne specific Elder Orb is a &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt; found inside &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Planar%20Sphere\"&gt;The Planar Sphere&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Planar%20Sphere%23The%20Elder%20Orb%20Room\"&gt;Elder Orb Room&lt;/a&gt;, which is the room that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Planar%20Sphere%23The%20Navigator%27s%20Room\"&gt;Navigator's Room&lt;/a&gt;. The beholder will be engaged and tanked by the assembled &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Golem\"&gt;Guardian Golem&lt;/a&gt;, after the golem opens the locked door to the beholder's room.\nThis beholder has 100% magic resistance. It casts no spells. It has scripted use of &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt;, Cause Serious Wounds Ray, Charm Person Ray, Death Ray, Disintegrate Ray, Domination Ray, Fear Ray, and Flesh to Stone Ray.\nThe script for this Orb will direct its attention at the Guardian Golem over any party member. It is scripted to face the Guardian Golem and fire several eye beams at it (although they will have no effect because the golem has no dispellable effects upon it and has 100% magic resistance). It would take some bizarre actions by the player to make the beholder target a party member in this scenario. The beholder can safely be destroyed by missile fire, or standing behind the golem, or even just positioning a party member to the side of the Elder Orb and melee attacking it while the Golem occupies its attention. This Beholder is more of a plot device than some kind of obstacle to overcome.\nElder Orbs in the Southern Tunnels.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb%20%28Underdark%29\"&gt;Elder Orbs&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Southern Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;. See the link for details.\nThese beholders cast some spells to buff themselves, destroy summoned creatures with a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, counter Silence with a &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; and use their various beholder eye beams as well.\nOne Elder Orb here (UDELDER) has its own creature file design and differs slightly than the second Elder Orb, which uses the parameters shown in the InfoBox. They both use the same AI script for behavior and spell/eye beam use.\nElder Orbs in the Test of Fear.\nA trio of Elder Orbs may be encountered in Chapter 7 within the &lt;a href=\"The%20Abyss\"&gt;The Abyss&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Abyss%29\"&gt;Test of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting these beholders is optional.\nThese Orbs are shown in the Info Box. The Elder orb version found in chapter 7 is a bit more robust and powerful than the version encountered in the Underdark.\nSee the InfoBox for scripted spell and eye beam use.\nElder Orb in the Watcher's Keep.\nOne can be found in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Final%20Seal\"&gt;Final Seal level&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Globe\"&gt;Green Globe&lt;/a&gt; scenario. This version uses the same creature file and script as in the InfoBox.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod changes elder orbs, and they also get additional scripting refinements if the \"Smarter Beholder\" component is installed.\nElder Orbs are raised from a 9 HD creature to level 20.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unseeing%20Eye\"&gt;Unseeing Eye&lt;/a&gt; is reconfigured into an Elder Orb.\nSCS and the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20Mod\"&gt;Tactics Mod&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the &lt;a href=\"Tactics%20for%20BG2EE\"&gt;Tactics for BG2EE&lt;/a&gt; mod) redesigns &lt;a href=\"Vaxall\"&gt;Vaxall&lt;/a&gt; from an ordinary beholder in the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Rune%20Hideout\"&gt;Twisted Rune Hideout&lt;/a&gt; as an Elder Orb as well.\nWith SCS Elder Orbs have use of mage spell casting and beholder eye ray attacks, usually both in the same round. Beholders have an always on permanent alacrity power allowing multiple spell casts and beholder eye beams in the same round - the usual timing restriction on this limits this to one spell and one eye beam ray per round, or two eye beam rays per round.\nSCS Elder Orbs can see invisible and hidden creatures by script. They also have immunities to being Webbed, and Entangled as they levitate.\nSCS Elder Orbs have additional spells available and can summon help like &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; creatures. They have spell protection removers such as &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; are prepared and can be instantly released by script.\nThey are unaffected by their own eye beams in case they were reflected. All SCS beholders have a Telekinesis Ray, that is used depending on the game difficulty setting, usually after a few rounds and seeks out the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Cloak of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player's game difficulty selection determines which Beholder Eye beams are used against the player. The deadlier beams like Disintegration Ray are used on \"Hardcore\" and \"Insane\" difficulty."}
{"id": "51929", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51929", "title": "Elder Orb (Underdark)", "text": "Elder Orb (Underdark) are very mature (and powerful) beholders. Though they have lost the function of some of their eyestalks, they have more hit points than ordinary beholders and are able to cast spells, some instantly. They can also use the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt; as well as several others.\nGameplay.\nThis specific Elder Orb is a found within the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Southern Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; reachable from the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first of two Elder orbs are encountered in the initial chamber in the Southern Tunnels. The creature will deploy two self-buff protective spells, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Then the creature will go on the offensive by either casting further arcane spells or firing Beholder Eye rays of various types at the closest valid target. An &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt; is likely the first eye ray attempted.\nIf the monster isn't killed or disabled quickly, there is a danger that a party member could get exposed to some instant death beholder rays, such as Death Ray or Flesh to Stone. The longer the Elder Orb has to sequentially work down the scripted rays and spells it is assigned, the more dangerous it can be, to include an &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nNote that the Orb has an inherent 50% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game may have toned down the power of this Elder Orb, as it only has 9 Hit Dice (which is well below what it typically would be). And this of course can put its &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; contingency cast at a disadvantage. Another observation is that the very first chamber in the dungeon provides access to the Elder Orb sought by the party - the creature that has the component which &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Ardulace%20Despana\"&gt;Matron Mother Ardulace Despana&lt;/a&gt; requires to conduct her summoning ritual as part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; questline. If this seems a bit too convenient, then the player may be correct. This can be changed with installation of a challenge enhancing mod - see \"Mod content\" below for options.\nOn the other hand, if the party is seeking the &lt;a href=\"Eyestalk%20of%20an%20Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Eyestalk of an Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and only desires this to complete a quest item - and doesn't want to enter further within the tunnels - then the early access to the Elder Orb means the party can leave the tunnels with the loot, and not be exposed to any other dangers (and miss out on the other experience and items in the Tunnels as well).\nNote the special items dropped by this creature when defeated, listed in the InfoBox.\nA second Elder Orb is present in this tunnel system, further into the dungeon. It has the same stats as the first Orb, uses the same script but carries no droppable loot/items (ref: BEHELD01.cre).\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod moves the Elder Orb further back inside the tunnels. So, the first {and second Elder Orb) are deeper within the dungeon. The mod also makes a number of changes to the creature, including the AI scripts and also adds some additional powers and immunities to the creature. The Orb is now a level 20 creature with SCS. It is under a permanent &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Free Action (status effect)&lt;/a&gt;, is immune to its own beholder rays (in case they were reflected upon itself), has a passive alacrity effect that allows multiple spell actions each round to include spell casting and beholder eye ray attacks in the same round without any cool down pause. It also speeds up the casting time for arcane spells.\nWhen hostilities commence the Orb deploys a contingency that launches several spells simultaneously. These include &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; {cast previously), &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Moment of Prescience\" with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt; mod), and two &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Djinni\"&gt;Summon Djinni&lt;/a&gt; creatures are conjured for support. All of these spells instantly manifest and can't be interrupted.\nSeconds later the Orb launches a rapid firing Cause Serious Wounds ray and then a &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Ray\"&gt;Anti-Magic Ray&lt;/a&gt; - and simultaneously a Spell Sequencer containing a &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Spider&lt;/a&gt; summoned creatures - which will be placed so as to completely surround the targeted party member. At the same time the Djinn will be casting their own spells. The battlefield will be full of extra opponents very quickly.\nIt will be absolutely much more challenging and dangerous than the unmodified version. It will behoove the party to take down the Orb as soon as practical to limit opportunities for the Orb to keep spamming spell casts and beholder rays in the same round (sometimes as many as three actions per round because of its permanent alacrity power). On the game difficulty setting of Hardcore and Insane the creature is markedly more effective in battle. Note that the creature will recognize the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Cloak of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, and any spell protections upon a party member. It will use its \"Telekinesis Ray\" to steal the Shield of Balduran and the Cloak of Mirroring (as will any of the beholders) in this area.\nThe Orb has a large spell book of arcane magic memorized. It can cast &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; against summoned creatures, &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, some offensive spells, and retains the &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nThe mod will install various Icewind Dale spells for the Orb to use if that component is selected. This will also work if the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; and or the &lt;a href=\"IWDification\"&gt;IWDification&lt;/a&gt; mods are also installed."}

Unlike most companions, he will stay rooted to the spot if &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; turns him down - and thus, denies acceptance into the party - easily allowing one to ponder his offer further.\nHe has to pair with Skie. Accordingly, if he has never been recruited, he will disappear from his area in the Cloakwood if she has been killed or has otherwise permanently disappeared from Baldur's Gate.

However, if Skie leaves because of low &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;, Eldoth will stay with the player and the pair will separate.\nGameplay.\nEldoth, &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Il-Khan\"&gt;Dorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baeloth%20Barrityl\"&gt;Baeloth&lt;/a&gt; have the highest &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt; (16) of any evil members, making him an excellent leader for evil parties to gain store discounts and favorable reaction adjustments. He also comes with a unique Create &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Arrow\"&gt;Poisoned Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s ability to create 5 arrows per day which only he can use.\nHe nets you a good fortune from looting &lt;a href=\"Entar%20Silvershield%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Entar Silvershield's Estate&lt;/a&gt; and blackmailing &lt;a href=\"Elkart\"&gt;Elkart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%20and%20Stars\"&gt;Blade and Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe joins equipped with only Darts, a dagger and Studded Leather armor. His starting spells (dependent on level) should include &lt;a href=\"Larloch%27s%20Minor%20Drain\"&gt;Larloch's Minor Drain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt;.

This Lich may be encountered as part the &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Kangaxx%27s%20body\"&gt;Restore Kangaxx's body&lt;/a&gt; questline. The Elemental Lich guards body parts of &lt;a href=\"Kangaxx\"&gt;Kangaxx&lt;/a&gt;, which are stored within the sarcophagus. If a player interacts with the sarcophagus and attempts to open it, the Elemental Lich will rise from the Crypt Floor, and regardless of anything the party may say - eventually turn hostile. It will attempt to destroy you, the would-be Crypt robbers. The name \"Elemental Lich\" is derived by the fact that no name is mentioned directly as to this creature's actual name, however the game combat screen identifies it as the Elemental Lich. \nElemental Lich abilities.\nThis lich is equipped with three undroppable items which bestow the creature's immunities and protections, and its melee touch attack. These are:\n&lt;a href=\"RING95.ITM\"&gt;RING95.ITM&lt;/a&gt; for the general Undead protections. See the item link for specifics.\n&lt;a href=\"LICH.ITM\"&gt;LICH.ITM&lt;/a&gt; for lich specific protections. See the item link for specifics.\n&lt;a href=\"LICH02.ITM\"&gt;LICH02.ITM&lt;/a&gt; for the touch attack melee weapon. See the item link for specifics.\nMod content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod will improve the Elemental Lich's AI noticeably over the basic and unmodified EE versions of the creature. If the SCS Smarter Mages component is also installed, this Lich will be even more formidable, in that it will utilize triggers, sequencers and contingency abilities. This component also works with the game difficulty settings, and this could mean that a Lich will also have access, and use, Mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt;. \nSCS makes the Elemental Lich a Level 30 Invoker (it could also be an enchanter, conjurer or necromancer - depends on the installation variable) - and uses a custom designed Lich Invoker AI script. It is immune to &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; effects, plus all the one's in the unmodified creature.\nAs soon as hostilities are initiated, an uninterruptable series of protective buffs will be deployed as \"previously cast\" and a spell trigger and or contingency that will basically make the lich invulnerable to most damage types including magical damage, and 75% protected from acid. It will also be protected from magical weapons. \nIn fact, the following spells will be implemented as buffs on the Lich: &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Greater Spell Deflection\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Divination&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Dispelling Screen\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt; and \"Mind Blank\" with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;SR&lt;/a&gt;. \nA few seconds later while invisible, an instant application of &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; takes place. At this moment the Lich will be protected being struck and nearly immune to elemental and magical damage - and can't be targeted at all. This will give it time to attempt a Remove Magic on the party or perhaps go directly to a Time Stop.\nWhen a Timestop is cast, during the pause will be cast other spells, and perhaps even a Spell Trigger during the interval. As the lich is an invoker, expect heavy use of damage dealing evocation spells. The party will have a -2 on saving throws against these (unless the party member is also an Invoker). The lich will attack with &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; in between spell casts at point blank and missile range. All spells listed in the paragraph below are scripted for use and variably selected based on vulnerability assessments and available detected targets.\nMany different memorized spells are assigned, and all can be used by the AI. Examples include (not all are listed): &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hands\"&gt;Burning Hands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Orb\"&gt;Chromatic Orb&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Shocking%20Grasp\"&gt;Shocking Grasp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Invisibility\"&gt;Improved Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Malison\"&gt;Greater Malison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delayed%20Blast%20Fireball\"&gt;Delayed Blast Fireball&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Khelben%27s%20Warding%20Whip\"&gt;Khelben's Warding Whip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bigby%27s%20Crushing%20Hand\"&gt;Bigby's Crushing Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incendiary%20Cloud\"&gt;Incendiary Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meteor%20Swarm\"&gt;Meteor Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wish\"&gt;Wish&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, Mage HLA's are available, including &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Breath%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Dragon's Breath (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades (wizard)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt;. \nAll SCS liches can see invisible creatures, and this cannot be blocked or dispelled. \nThis creature will employ a \"Fear Aura\" ability, an innate power they may use with a fairly large area of effect. A saving throw negates, but it is unaffected by spell level protections and magic resistance. It causes a &lt;a href=\"Panic\"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; effect and lasts a turn.

It should also be noted that Poison damage is really not treated as an elemental damage by the game engine in any consistent way. For instance, the 7th Level arcane spell &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20The%20Elements\"&gt;Protection From The Elements&lt;/a&gt; excludes poison damage, and the 8th level arcane spell &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Energy\"&gt;Protection From Energy&lt;/a&gt; also does not add poison damage as an \"energy type\". For most intents and purposes, Poison Damage is a stand-alone damage type in the game.

The thief also uses a &lt;a href=\"Buckler%20%2B1\"&gt;Buckler +1&lt;/a&gt; in the shield hand, and a mod-only undroppable weapon known as \"Soultaker\" Dagger. Eler will also flick &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Throwing%20Dagger\"&gt;Poisoned Throwing Dagger&lt;/a&gt; attacks for ranged combat.\nThe Soultaker dagger is a unique weapon that is non-magical but is coated in a nasty alchemical compound that upon a hit requires a save vs death or be poisoned for 10 seconds and inflicting 2 damage per second. A strike also causes a no save slow effect lasting only a few seconds. However - it's amazing power is that a hit target will be suffer a &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; effect and a &lt;a href=\"Spellstrike\"&gt;Spellstrike&lt;/a&gt; effect combination. Those effects bypass magic resistance.\nEler has an innate &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell that can be cast in 2 seconds on self and can be done four times. This may help to facilitate repeated backstabs."}

They are slightly shorter and more delicate than humans and are not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the sword coast perhaps because they prefer the wild to human cities. While they are well known as a cheerful and frolicsome race, many elves, especially drow, are as surly as &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; or as prideful as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are many racial divisions of elves: Gold elves, drow (aka dark elves), moon elves, sea elves, wild elves, and winged elves (aka avariel). Elves are generally liked and even admired by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and are easily accepted into their society. The same cannot be said for &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; some of whom despise elves on principle.\nSubraces.\nDrow.\n&lt;a href=\"Drow\"&gt;Drow&lt;/a&gt; are a subterranean race of elves. They have dark grayish skin and are significantly different than surface elves in culture and attitude. Drow society is matriarchal, and drow women tend to view men of any race as inferior and weak to the point of misandry. Drow of either gender are stigmatized as evil by most non-Drow throughout Faer\u00fbn.\nAvariel.\nAvariel (or winged elves) have feathered wings and are capable of flight. They are more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They have pale skin and slightly larger than normal eyes.\nAvariel are said to have the most beautiful voices of all the elves. This makes them highly sought after by &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;s. \n&lt;a href=\"Aerie\"&gt;Aerie&lt;/a&gt; is the only known avariel in the .\nClasses.\nAccessible Classes.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Diviner&lt;/a&gt;, Enchanter, &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Mage\"&gt;Wild Mage&lt;/a&gt; specializations), &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;\nAccessible Multi-Classes.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Fighter / Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Mage/ Thief&lt;/a&gt;\nElf is an excellent race to choose when playing a ranged character. Their ability to get 19 Dex allows them to get an extra +1 ranged THAC0 at character creation, which stacks with their Bow bonus. They also make great thieves for the same reasons, good rangers. They are initially disadvantaged as fighters due to their constitution penalty but it is possible to create an elf character who can hold their own in a melee.\nThe penalty can be compensated for and may not matter by game's end if you are willing to stack both the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Bodily%20Health\"&gt;Manual of Bodily Health&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate (game)&lt;/a&gt; and the +1 Constitution bonus from the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Lum%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; on the same elf. If you also use the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Quickness%20of%20Action\"&gt;Manual of Quickness of Action&lt;/a&gt; and use the Dexterity upgrade from the Machine, you'll have 21 Dexterity. This provides -1 bonus &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; and better ranged THAC0 than any other race (save for &lt;a href=\"Halfling\"&gt;Halfling&lt;/a&gt;s). The extra THAC0 bonus with Bows and Swords helps should you choose to use those weapons. The manual suggests these bonuses are only obtained with &lt;a href=\"longbows\"&gt;longbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"long%20swords\"&gt;long swords&lt;/a&gt;, but in fact, they apply to all bows and all swords.\nElves also make great thieves, unkitted mages, sorcerers and wild mages, as those classes stop gaining any bonuses from constitution after 16 points (so elves are not disadvantaged in terms of HPs).\nThe mage specializations available to elves however are not that good. Diviners are barred from casting , while Enchanters are barred from which contains 90% of all direct damage incantations.\nRelated items.\nItem better for Elves:\n&lt;a href=\"Savage%20Shortbow\"&gt;Savage Shortbow&lt;/a&gt; "}

He advises that previous contacts of the party should be able to assist if needed.\nThe party's journal updates and records &lt;a href=\"The%20Elven%20City%20Requires%20My%20Aid\"&gt;The Elven City Requires My Aid&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nNote that for plot purposes, Elhan can't be killed (as evidenced by his &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;). It is pointless to attack the elves in this scenario, and frankly will gum up your ultimate game saga, so don't try it. There's plenty of opportunity for violent release ahead in the rest of the game.\nNote about the geas.\nThis geas accepted by Viconia seems not to actually implement anything specific in the game. It is more of a theatrical plot convention. However, if the party attacks any of the elves in this area, including Elhan, the PC will be killed by a scripted plot function, and it will be game over.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/RoxanneSHS/LensHunt\"&gt;Broken Lanthorn&lt;/a&gt; mod will initiate when the party returns to speak with Elhan after the party has recovered the Rhynn Lanthorn."}

It gives the giant a +3 THAC0 bonus, deals 2d12 slashing damage and 1d12 fire damage on any successful strike.

The adjusted Attacks per Round (APR) for the giant is 2.5.\nThe Elite Fire Giant is healed by fire damage. The AI script will utilize carried potions depending on script timers and availability in the inventory. Typically, one will be consumed within 1 round of hostilities, such as the oil of speed. Healing potions are used based on incurred damage percent and situational triggers.\nGameplay.\nThe Elite Fire Giant will move toward a detected enemy and quickly consume one potion from its inventory (might be the Oil of Speed, or the Potion of Invulnerability). Once in weapon range it will engage in melee combat with its special Battle Axe. Expect it to hit frequently if your only protection is Armor Class rating.

In the classic game there may be a way around the ring (same as with other creatures that wear it). \nIn both versions of the game, the intention is that the manifestation can only be slain by curative magic such as &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Light%20Wounds%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Cure Light Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lay%20on%20Hands%20%28paladin%29\"&gt;Lay on Hands&lt;/a&gt;, or other spells. \nHowever, this usually requires a character to touch the creature, opening them up to its melee attacks.\nDistracting it may prove difficult. One way to deal with the interruptions is to use &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s fast casting &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Light%20Wounds%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Cure Light Wounds (ability)&lt;/a&gt;, if they have it. \nAnother tactic is to cast multiple healing spells from more than one party members at the same time, if the party has the resources to do so.\nFurther within the temple is a non-obvious container that holds a healing spell scroll which can be used for this purpose as well (and a spell cast from a scroll cannot be interrupted).\nOnce healing is applied, the MinHP1 ring is destroyed, and so shall be the manifestation. Then the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Amaunator\"&gt;Avatar of Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; will appear and address the party."}

{"id": "32717", "revid": "46775035", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32717", "title": "Enchanted item", "text": "Items in the may be enchanted. This is not to be confused with an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href=\"Magical%20item\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt;, and in this context, the terminology not always follows the one used in the \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3ADungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons\"&gt;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aforgottenrealms%3A2nd%20edition%20sourcebooks\"&gt;2nd edition sourcebook&lt;/a&gt; publications.\nEnchantment strength.\nIn \"Baldur's Gate\" games, many creatures have skin, shell or magic that makes them entirely immune to &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"ammunition\"&gt;ammunition&lt;/a&gt;s that are not strong enough. Such weapons will be unable to deal damage and unable to apply the on-hit effects they may carry. The combat logs display the message \"Weapon ineffective\" when a weapon or ammo strikes an immune target, and if it's a party member attacking, they are likely going to be vocal about it.\nWhether a weapon is strong enough is quantified with the \"enchantment strength\" or level \u2014 a number between 0 and 6, with 0 sometimes referred to as non-enchanted. When landing a blow with a weapon, typically thanks to a successful &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;attack roll&lt;/a&gt;, its enchantment strength is checked to decide if it's going to be enough to cause any harm to the target, or if it's going to be ineffective. For example, the famous katana \"&lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Fury\"&gt;Celestial Fury&lt;/a&gt;\" has no use whatsoever against a sound asleep and defenseless &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Solar\"&gt;Fallen Solar&lt;/a&gt;, because it is a spiritual being that can only be harmed by weapons if they have at least enchantment level 4.\nWhen it comes to ranged attacks, only the enchantment level of the ammunition matters: though &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crossbows\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slings\"&gt;slings&lt;/a&gt; do have their own enchantment level, they are typically not used to bonk the target's head but to propel ammo into it. Therefore it's the level of the arrow, bolt or bullet that counts. The only time when a launcher's enchantment strength matters is when it generates its own ammunition, like &lt;a href=\"Tansheron%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Tansheron's Bow&lt;/a&gt;: In that case, the launcher's enchantment value is passed on to the projectile it created. See the &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;Bugs section&lt;/a&gt; for an exception to the exception.\nEnchanted versus magical.\nIt can be useful to keep in mind that whether or not an item is enchanted has no bearing on it being &lt;a href=\"Magical%20item\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt;. A weapon or ammo can be magical and have enchantment level 0, like the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Dispelling\"&gt;Arrow of Dispelling&lt;/a&gt;, or it can have enchantment level 6 and be non-magical, like the summons from &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Totemic%20Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; reaches level 10.\nStill, the vast majority of weapons with non-zero enchantment are actually magical, and the vast majority of weapons with enchantment zero are not.\nImmunities found in game.\nThe game applies enchantment and magical immunities through defensive spells or through a set of innate, permanent effects. A spell or set may target the enchantment level, the magical nature, or both at the same time. For example the immunities granted by &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Normal Weapons&lt;/a&gt; are targeted at respectively magical weapons and non-magical weapons, regardless of enchantment. On the other hand, the &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt; type of spells and most innate creature immunities actually contain two immunities: One to non-magical weapons regardless of enchantment, and one to all weapons below a certain enchantment level, whether magical or not.\nSee the wiki's category for creatures sorted by their immunity to enchantment levels, and for those immune to magical weapons and ammo.\nHow enchantment level is reported in-game.\nThe game is not consistent about informing the player of a weapon's enchantment level, but it is very often listed in the weapon's name, for example &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20%2B3\"&gt;Long Sword +3&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20%2B4\"&gt;Bullet +4&lt;/a&gt;. Failing that, the item description often talks about it, but the wiki or a file explorer like &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt; should be the best resources. See the wiki's category for items sorted by enchantment level, or check the infobox within a specific item's page.\nAll items have an enchantment value, but only weapons and ammunition matter to game mechanics. The game mostly mentions enchantment for those and for armor, shields and a few items \"of protection\" like the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Protection%20%2B2\"&gt;Cloak of Protection +2&lt;/a&gt;.\nConfusion with other bonuses.\nMost enchanted weapons in game offer &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speed%20Factor\"&gt;speed factor&lt;/a&gt; bonuses equivalent to their enchantment level. For example the \"Long Sword +3\" has a level 3 enchantment and gives +3 THAC0, +3 damage and -3 speed factor bonuses, but it's not a rule, as illustrated by the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Staff of the Magi&lt;/a&gt;. This staff has a level 5 enchantment but only +1 bonuses to THAC0 and damage \u2014 it can harm creatures immune to enchantment 0 to 4.\nFor armors and shields, they tend to offer an &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;Armor Class&lt;/a&gt; bonus equivalent to their enchantment level, for example the enchantment level 2 &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Mail%20%2B2\"&gt;Full Plate Mail +2&lt;/a&gt; offers a +2 AC bonus over the enchantment level 0 &lt;a href=\"Full%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Full Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt;. But again, it's not a rule, and armor enchantment does not actually affect gameplay. Finally, items \"of protection\" may offer an AC and a &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; bonus equivalent to their enchantment level, but yet again that level is ignored by game mechanics.\nEnemies that can only be hit by +3 and over weapon enchantments.\nThese lists should be fairly complete, but a few enemies could be missing (such as those from the Black Pits II and SoD).\nEnemies that require +3 enchantment to hit:\nEnemies that require +4 enchantment to hit:\nEnemy that requires +5 enchantment to hit:"}

For instance, if the party leaves the Elves area and selects a &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; location provided by a mod, then it probably won't trigger.\nIf the player selects the &lt;a href=\"Umar%20Hills\"&gt;Umar Hills&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Trademeet\"&gt;Trademeet&lt;/a&gt;, the script is unlikely to trigger. If it fails, reload and try again, as the script is a bit buggy sometimes.\nThe most probable locations to successfully initiate this encounter area is &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20City%20Gates\"&gt;Athkatla City Gates&lt;/a&gt; locations.\nGameplay.\nThe party enters at the bottom of the map (south). At the opposite end will be observed &lt;a href=\"Drizzt%20Do%27Urden\"&gt;Drizzt Do'Urden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfgar\"&gt;Wulfgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cattie-Brie\"&gt;Cattie-Brie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruenor\"&gt;Bruenor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regis\"&gt;Regis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area script takes control of the initial presentation of the encounter with various dialogue between Drizzt and his companions - going back and forth about Bruenor's lost war hammer. During this time the player has no opportunity to interact with any of the party.\nEventually Drizzt addresses the party and dialogue options are available to reply.\nThe dialogue will possibly meander and can be lengthy based on the statements made by the PC. If the party wishes they can make this encounter a hostile one very quickly - or can delay that and make it hostile a little later - or they can actually be friendly or neutral in tone. \nDialogue choices from Drizzt may differ if the party has a reputation less than 12.\nDialogue choices may differ if \"Player1\" (usually this is Gorion's Ward) is of evil alignment.\nSome specific dialogue paths may be adjusted if \"Player1\" produces a &lt;a href=\"Reaction\"&gt;Reaction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;7, 8 - 14, and 15+ as well.\nIf the player imported a PC from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;BG I&lt;/a&gt; and ever possessed any of Drizzt's equipment in the party inventory - then he should recognize the main character and start off making that accusation that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is a bandit - this can lead to potential hostiles. Various Bioware party companions have dialogue interjections here, as well as &lt;a href=\"Bruenor\"&gt;Bruenor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cattie-Brie\"&gt;Cattie-Brie&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player named their main character \"Drizzt\" or \"Drizzt Do'Urden\" - then there is dialogue about that as well.\nSome of the dialogue may seem to be leading to hostilities, but there are often some replies that can deescalate the temper a bit and steer the conversation back down to neutral. It is all up to the player to decide how they want this encounter to unfold.\nIf the party wishes, they may just let Drizzt and his companions carry on and they'll leave the area of their own accord. The party can ask for help against the planned confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; that is necessary in the future. If Drizzt agrees to help, he and his band will meet the PC in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt; and already be inside to assist with the vampires, during &lt;a href=\"The%20final%20battle%20with%20Bodhi\"&gt;The final battle with Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nIf Drizzt agrees to help the party, he and his group walk off the area screen and the player's journal updates:\nSome core party members have dialogue interjections during the encounter. &lt;a href=\"Viconia%20DeVir\"&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt; may be noticed for being a drow, and she has some replies. &lt;a href=\"Jaheira\"&gt;Jaheira&lt;/a&gt; will recognize Drizzt as a Harper ally. She will also protest if the party fight Drizzt and leave the encounter for the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Docks\"&gt;Athkatla Docks&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Galvarey%20Estate\"&gt;Galvarey Estate&lt;/a&gt; entrance.\nShould the party provoke or otherwise end up in a fight, then at this point the player can take control of the party characters now. At the same time, Drizzt and his companions will be quaffing potions and then moving to attack. \nDrizzt's companion panther &lt;a href=\"Guenhwyvar\"&gt;Guenhwyvar&lt;/a&gt; is also summoned into the fray with a \"druid summon animal\" style animation.\nDrizzt and Bruenor will engage in melee combat, Cattie Brie will typically stay with bow fire attacks, Wulfgar will throw his hammer, if possible, but also switch to melee mode if pressed upon in close quarters.\nAt the beginning of the battle Cattie-Brie and Regis will most likely be under the effects of invisibility.\nDrizzt will likely apply an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Stone%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Stone Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;. Bruenor, and the others may consume a potion as well. All of the group are scripted to try and heal themselves with a potion when damaged to at least 50% of original HP.\nAs the party is in chapter 6, the odds are that the player's forces will be equal or more powerful than Drizzt and company. Since they don't use spell casting, they really won't stand much of a chance in this fight. Expect a win for balanced party. Even a solo character can handle this fight most likely.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Drizzt and his companions slightly with improved AI scripting for better tactical behavior and more in-battle potion use and potion variety."}

Right now I'm lookin' for some strong sword arms\" and he offers up the job to find out what happened to one of his caravans that didn't make it to the Gate.\nIf asked for more information, Kagain reveals that he's \"been having a lot of problems\" with &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s recently, but that they usually would let the caravans go. Not in this case, however, about which he normally \"wouldn't give one damn\" \u2013 wasn't it for &lt;a href=\"Entar%20Silvershield\"&gt;Entar Silvershield&lt;/a&gt; being the father of one of the missing passengers.\nIf accepting the job and Kagain's payment, he will join as a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;, and an eight day counter starts until he will remind &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.

Anyway, to the east and up the hillside, past the single overthrown wagon, &lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt; will recognize the body of Entar's son among the victims of a larger caravan \u2013 unless it took more than one day to find it since having arrived here. In the latter case, he will have lost interest in the task, with job and &lt;a href=\"%23Rewards\"&gt;reward&lt;/a&gt; canceled.\nIf found in time, Kagain now believes that, with &lt;a href=\"Entar%20Silvershield\"&gt;Silvershield's&lt;/a&gt; son being under his responsibility when killed, he is a wanted dwarf, and as he deduces that &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; is after the &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s too, he offers to help them gain revenge \"on those scumbags\" and accompany the party permanently. Depending on how he &lt;a href=\"Reaction\"&gt;reacted&lt;/a&gt; to the person who negotiated this job with him, he might even have some payment, in addition to the few items that can be found on site.\nIf you manually speak to Kagain at the 3 wagon site he will finish the quest.\nIf Skie is present upon completion of the quest she will mourn: \u201c*sniffle* I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead.\u201d\nRewards.\nBesides having gained a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;, there's no reward for this &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\". \"(See also &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;.)\"\nIn the \"\", the exact material reward depends on &lt;a href=\"Kagain\"&gt;Kagain&lt;/a&gt;'s reaction to the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; member who made the deal with him.

See &lt;a href=\"Getting%20inside%20the%20asylum\"&gt;Getting inside the asylum&lt;/a&gt; for methods to do so. Also see &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Main%20Floor\"&gt;Spellhold Main Floor&lt;/a&gt; for details once inside.\nIrenicus strips the PC's bhaalspawn soul essence.\nIn a cutscene the player will resume the quest within a laboratory located in the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Basement\"&gt;Spellhold Basement&lt;/a&gt; - a scene plays out involving the death of several shadow thieves whose extermination is used to power some kind of sophisticated apparatus; resulting in the protagonist being drained of certain essential forces while trapped in a glass tube/cage.\nIrenicus will reveal that he stole some fundamental part of Gorion's Ward's soul, using it to heal himself of some unknown affliction (this causes you to lose all of your special bhaalspawn innate abilities). \nCandlekeep Bhaal dream.\nThe protaganist then is transitioned to a cut scene scenario detailed on the &lt;a href=\"Dreams%20%28Shadows%20of%20Amn%29\"&gt;Dreams (Shadows of Amn)&lt;/a&gt; page.\nAfter the dream sequence the player will also learn that the same thing happened to Imoen, and also, that she is a bhaalspawn as well. After some banter, threats, vows of vengeance etc. he will depart the lab to continue with his master plan, leaving the PC a drained and soulless husk. The PC and the rest of the party are handed over to &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; to do with as she pleases.\nBodhi initiates the asylum hunt.\nBodhi will transport the party to the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;Asylum Dungeon's first floor&lt;/a&gt;, declaring that she wants the party to try and solve their way through this labyrinth of monsters, traps and trials, whilst she will intermittently hunt them down. She then departs, but not before reuniting Gorion's Ward with Imoen at long last. If the party lost Yoshimo, she will immediately join the party to fill the slot. If the party did not include Yoshimo, the player can choose to add Imoen to the party or instruct her to escape on her own. If that option is taken expect a poor verbal reaction from some core party members. Imoen will then depart the dungeon level (somehow) and can be located later in the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; (somehow). If the party already has six party members and the player wants to add Imoen, then one party member will have to be dismissed, and if so, will depart spellhold and then be recruitable again at their usual place (somehow).\nThe party must make their way through all three levels of the Asylum Dungeon, then navigate the &lt;a href=\"Apparition%20%28Spellhold%29\"&gt;Arbiters examination&lt;/a&gt; until they finally return to the main floor of Spellhold. Thanks to Irenicus stealing their soul, Gorion's Ward has lost their original &lt;a href=\"Bhaalspawn\"&gt;Bhaalspawn&lt;/a&gt; abilities - but, on the third level of the labyrinth dungeon, in a scripted encounter, they will gain a replacement power; &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the party has convinced the arbiters that they should be released from the asylum, they must deal with &lt;a href=\"Lonk\"&gt;Lonk&lt;/a&gt; in order to acquire the keys to the inmates' cells. As Imoen explains, Irenicus is too powerful and too well protected to be defeated by a conventional assault, but an onslaught of insane spellcasters would be something else entirely. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; will also make an appearance and advise that the inmates are a resource to exploit against Irenicus. If the party decides to kill Saemon at this juncture, which is possible, then the player will shutter their path forward. They will be limited to using the portal to the underdark and the entire leaving the island quest as well as the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Underwater City&lt;/a&gt; adventure will not happen. \nFight Irenicus.\nThe newly expanded party must then fight a battle against Irenicus, covered in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20with%20Irenicus%20in%20Spellhold\"&gt;Battle with Irenicus in Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; article. When Irenicus is reduced to \"Near Death\" status, he will teleport away, but the asylum inmates will be killed in a scripted event. This then activates the second phase of the battle, against a number of enemy assassins, whose ability to hide in shadows and then backstab is a threat not to be underestimated. At the same time, if Yoshimo was brought to Spellhold, he will also appear and fight the party to the death, asking that if he dies, Gorion's Ward will take his heart to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ilmater%20%28Slums%20District%29\"&gt;the Temple of Ilmater in Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freeing%20Yoshimo%27s%20Soul\"&gt;so his soul can be freed&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the last of the &lt;a href=\"Murderer\"&gt;Murderer&lt;/a&gt; thieves are killed, the party is free to explore Spellhold. In the entry hall, the party will re-encounter &lt;a href=\"Saemon%20Havarian\"&gt;Saemon Havarian&lt;/a&gt; again (unless killed earlier), who offers a way to leave &lt;a href=\"Brynnlaw\"&gt;Brynnlaw&lt;/a&gt;; there is a key to a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; in the Director's study, available via a door nearby, or the party might be able to set sail on Saemon's ship. If the party tries to attack Saemon, then they are forced to take the portal.\nEntering the Director's Chambers requires slaying a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt; left behind to guard them. The party can find two of Irenicus' journals in these chambers, which provide some clue as to what he was doing, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Thunder%20and%20Lightning\"&gt;Staff of Thunder and Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Stone\"&gt;Rogue Stone&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Horn of Silence&lt;/a&gt;. If they have declined Saemon's offer they must take Jon's Key and return to the lower floor to open the hidden door to a portal to the Underdark, gaining 20,000 Quest EXP and completing Chapter 4 by immediately beginning Chapter 5.\nIf the party chooses to accept Saemon's offer of help, they must instead complete a miniature quest, &lt;a href=\"leaving%20the%20island\"&gt;leaving the island&lt;/a&gt;. This will result in them receiving the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Blade\"&gt;Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 20,000 Quest XP, and being taken to the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20City\"&gt;Underwater City&lt;/a&gt;. This is where they must &lt;a href=\"The%20prophecy%20of%20Sekolah\"&gt;end the sahuagin civil war&lt;/a&gt; before they can reach the Underdark and begin Chapter 5. An advantage to going this route is being able to visit stores and temples on the island in between adventures, relieving inventory pressure. Much unique treasure and further gameplay with XP rewards is also presented. Bypassing this route is possible, but the party will miss out on all the offerings of that path, while they will not miss out on any of the other, cause if they want they can re-enter the Asylum, kill the Stone Golem and get the Staff of Thunder and Lightning, the Rogue Stone and the Horn of Silence before leaving the island.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Asylum\"&gt;Improved Asylum&lt;/a&gt; adds further content to Bodhi's hunt in the asylum.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod component that is optionally installed (for challenge and realism) that disarms the party's equipment (they are captive prisoners after all) takes place just before resuming the quest in the &lt;a href=\"Spellhold%20Bodhi%27s%20Hunt%20Level%201\"&gt;Spellhold Bodhi's Hunt Level 1&lt;/a&gt; area."}

Killing either of these two results in the normal Reputation Loss for Murdering an Innocent. Containers in these two rooms provide random treasure.\nThe southeastern room is a Library with 4 Bookshelves, one of which has a Priest Scroll &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and a Wizard Scroll &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person\"&gt;Charm Person&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe southwestern room is a Study. The Desk has a Lightning Trap and contains one &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwest of the Study is another Bedroom with a locked chest, a small desk and two armoires, all with random treasure.\nWest of the stairs is a Bunking quarters with another House Guard; \"Cross blades with me and die!\" He is worth and carries &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20%2B1\"&gt;Arrows +1&lt;/a&gt; .

Every fisherman there knows her singing, but Evalt's brother &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be attracted to her the most. Since Evan is missing for two nights now, Evalt thinks his brother was &lt;a href=\"charmed\"&gt;charmed&lt;/a&gt; by the witch and fears for his life. The party can offer to look for him.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWalk-through.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nWhen passing the northwestern lagoon of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balduran%20North\"&gt;northern part of the isle&lt;/a&gt; in search for the missing brother, a blue lady, holding a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Evan%27s%20Body\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;, will stop the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; on the westernmost broadening of the sandy path and ask who gave them permission to approach her home. During this exchange and depending on the party's attitude towards the sirine queen and her deeds, she may explain herself or feel forced to use violence against them. The same is true for negotiating the delivery of that dead fisherman \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt;, the brother &lt;a href=\"Evalt\"&gt;Evalt&lt;/a&gt; feared for.\nIf it comes to a fight, the queen will be backed by four &lt;a href=\"sirines\"&gt;of her kin&lt;/a&gt;, two of whom appear at the southern end of the path and two in its north.\nIn either case, the party will end up with the body in their inventory or be able to take it from the sirine queen's remains.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMoral considerations.\nThe first question that arises would be to decide if \"happy to oblige\" and \"benefit\" for \"both parties\" can be considered true for a male being that was lured into the situation with magic \u2013 is this that much different from his own attempt to \"force himself upon\" the queen?\nGeneral interaction, point of view and behavior of &lt;a href=\"sirines\"&gt;sirines&lt;/a&gt; and \"land-dwellers\" towards each other could be considered, too. The whole conversation between the sirine queen and the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; is heated, though she shows a little more patience towards them than sirines usually do. The majority of more or less derogative terms comes from the party, such as \"your foul magic\" or \"blue-skinned wench\", together with general accusations of lying and murder \u2013 opposed to the claimed self-defense on the side of the queen, paired with calling &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; a \"beast\" and a \"monster\".\nRegarding &lt;a href=\"alignment\"&gt;alignment&lt;/a&gt; of involved parties: the sirine queen is &lt;a href=\"true%20neutral\"&gt;true neutral&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Evalt\"&gt;Evalt&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the brother of the dead fisherman and &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; giver, the one on whose behalf this conversation happens at all \u2013 is a &lt;a href=\"chaotic%20good\"&gt;chaotic good&lt;/a&gt; character. Nothing, however, is known about Evan himself.\nSome additional, minor details: Evalt's not interested in the way the party retrieved his &lt;a href=\"Evan%27s%20Body\"&gt;brother's body&lt;/a&gt; (\"read:\" there is no dialogue option to tell him), and the sirine queen shows feelings of solitude after having killed her proposed mating partner. Also, while speaking with her, for each choice there are always two options that will end in a battle with the sirine, opposed to only one diplomatic option each. Finally, the sirine queen never reveals her status as a \"queen\" and describes herself simply as a \"sirine\".\nPractical considerations.\nRegarding gained &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and material values, the difference between the two possible paths of solving this situation is quite big: 14,000 XP from defeating four &lt;a href=\"sirine\"&gt;sirine&lt;/a&gt;s and their queen \u2013 together with , several weapons, &lt;a href=\"arrows%20of%20biting\"&gt;arrows of biting&lt;/a&gt;, a number of &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Necklace\"&gt;necklace made out of them&lt;/a&gt; \u2013, opposed to solely 2,000 XP from retrieving the body diplomatically.\nIt's not possible to explain the chosen method to &lt;a href=\"Evalt\"&gt;Evalt&lt;/a&gt;, so his reward will always be the same: 900 XP.\nBugs.\nIn some versions of the game which infinitely duplicates the Sirine Queen, making the quest very difficult to complete."}

It is the home of the Baldur's Gate NPC &lt;a href=\"Xan\"&gt;Xan&lt;/a&gt;. As of the time the Baldur's Gate trilogy takes place, the population of the city is over 20,000. Very few non-elves know of the city, and even fewer have visited it. The only humans welcome within the city are members of the Harpers. \nThe city is protected by a powerful mythal, which bestows several magical effects upon people within its borders, the most notable being the ability to walk straight up and down walls as if effected by a spider climb spell. The mythal also has powerful defensive capabilities, but they are not often called upon. \nIt was at the outskirts of Evereska where &lt;a href=\"Prism\"&gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt; the sculptor saw &lt;a href=\"Ellesime\"&gt;Ellesime&lt;/a&gt;, who would be the inspiration for his final work.\nEvereska is not featured in any game in the Baldur's Gate trilogy, but it is referenced.\nGeography.\nEvereska is situated in the center of a crescent-shaped valley in the Western Heartlands, surrounded by hills on all sides, atop a large stone pedestal that rose high above the surrounding area. Access to the valley is limited, and the only ways in are by air or through a handful of heavily-guarded mountain passes. \nThe valley lies only 20 miles or so from the western border of Anauroch, and is bordered by the Greycloak Hills to the north. To the west lie the Marsh of Chelimber and the High Moor. No major roads lead to the city. The closest road is the Black Road, which passes east-west just north of the Greycloak Hills. The city of Baldur's Gate would be around a couple of weeks' journey to the southwest. \nGovernment and History.\nEvereska was founded in secret in -8600 D.R. to be a haven for the elven people. Today, Evereska is governed by a group of extremely old and powerful elves known as the Hill Elders. The city and surrounding area are guarded by several elite elven orders, including the Greycloaks and the Tomb Guard. "}

Speaking to him reveals he has a new offer; to use your sphere as the new &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; Academy of Magic. If you agree, you are given the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizard%20Badge\"&gt;Cowled Wizard Badge&lt;/a&gt;, a (currently unidentified) magic amulet.\nNew Residents.\nAfter agreeing, the Welcome Room (where the &lt;a href=\"Solamnic%20Knights\"&gt;Solamnic Knights&lt;/a&gt; were originally found) becomes occupied by several new figures; Teos, three Tutors, an Examiner, a Cowled Enforcer and &lt;a href=\"Vortel\"&gt;Vortel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rakshasa\"&gt;Rakshasa&lt;/a&gt; who acts as a merchant.\nApprentices and Tutors can now be found scattered throughout the various rooms on the top level of the Sphere.

Don't get too close to the golems, or you may take damage.\nMiniquests.\nAfter speaking to Teos once in the Welcome Room, do so again and he will tell you that the Cowled Wizards have lost a powerful magical artifact, one being warded by &lt;a href=\"Mystra\"&gt;Mystra&lt;/a&gt; herself, when its wardings blew up their research facility. He sends you to retrieve it from a Red Wizard spy, who is hiding in &lt;a href=\"Waukeen%27s%20Promenade\"&gt;Waukeen's Promenade&lt;/a&gt;. This spy can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20the%20Seven%20Vales\"&gt;Den of the Seven Vales&lt;/a&gt;; when spoken to, they will attack, and a Red Wizard will teleport in. These two mages are \"very\" high level, and can even cast 10th level spells like &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;! The traitorous Cowled Wizard is worth 15,000 EXP and drops an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%205%25%20Magic%20Resistance\"&gt;Amulet of 5% Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Neutral%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Neutral Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Cloak of Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt;, 2 scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt;, a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Spear\"&gt;Staff Spear&lt;/a&gt;, 500 gold pieces, and the Artifact that Teos sent you for. The Red Wizard is worth 30,000 EXP and drops &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Spell%20Warding\"&gt;Amulet of Spell Warding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Evil%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Evil Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Shield\"&gt;Cloak of the Shield&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard%20Ring\"&gt;Red Wizard Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Princes\"&gt;Ring of the Princes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Sleep\"&gt;Wand of Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Polymorphing\"&gt;Wand of Polymorphing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard%20Orders\"&gt;Red Wizard Orders&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Martial%20Staff\"&gt;Martial Staff&lt;/a&gt;, and 2000 gold pieces. Upon returning to Teos, you will receive 5,000 EXP and watch a cutscene as the Cowled Wizards attempt to unward the Artifact, only to produce... a rabbit. An ordinary rabbit. At this, you kick Teos out of the Sphere, although the rest of the students and tutors remain behind.\nWhen you speak to one Tutor in the Welcome Room, they will ask you retrieve a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; so they can copy it for the students. Retrieve it, and earn 1,000 EXP.\nWhen you speak to the Examiner, he will ask you to assess a quarter of students. If you agree, you will need to speak to each in turn. All will die, horribly, but you will earn 10,000 EXP for each of them. The female on the right will summon a &lt;a href=\"Nabassu\"&gt;Nabassu&lt;/a&gt; as she dies, so be prepared to fight it!\nWhen you speak to the Cowled Enforcer, they will ask you to hunt down and assassinate a member of the staff that they claim is secretly a spy for the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard\"&gt;Red Wizards of Thay&lt;/a&gt;. They will ask you to hunt down Inchantra, who they claim is in one of the far rooms beyond the control room. She can be found in the Mushroom Grove; upon entry, she accuses Gorion's Ward of being a Thayvian spy named Varius and attacks, even if the player tries to reason with her. She drops an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%27s%20Robe\"&gt;Adventurer's Robe&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dagger\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Retrieval\"&gt;Potion of Retrieval&lt;/a&gt;, and two magic rings; the &lt;a href=\"Circlet%20of%20Infernal%20Shielding\"&gt;Circlet of Infernal Shielding&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tutor%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Tutor's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, the Cowled Enforcer reveals himself to be the \"real\" Thayvian spy, Varius, and sheds his disguise before attacking as a Rune Assassin. When slain, he is worth 4,500 EXP and drops leather armor, a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Short Sword +1&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Extra%20Healing\"&gt;Potion of Extra Healing&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Jasper%20Gem\"&gt;Jasper Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Golem Room, a baatazu will claim to have been given permission to practice in the Planar Sphere with several diabolic apprentices, but is being magically restrained by protective wards for obvious reasons. It asks you to use a Scroll of Steal Spell to steal the spells being used to restrain it from &lt;a href=\"Wielter\"&gt;Wielter&lt;/a&gt;. After doing this, he will declare that the spell is tied to Wielter's lifeforce, and the Cowled Wizard must be slain to break the wards; since he cannot do so himself without breaking contract. The player can either agree for a larger reward, or refuse. If they refuse, the baatezu turns hostile and attacks; if killed, it's worth 16,000 EXP. If they kill Wielter, he is worth 8,000 EXP and drops 451 Gold Pieces, &lt;a href=\"Barrier%20Robes\"&gt;Barrier Robes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Mace\"&gt;Staff Mace&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Ring of Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bracers%20of%20Defense%20AC%208\"&gt;Bracers of Defense AC 8&lt;/a&gt;, and Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt;. The baatezu will reward the player for this act with 60,000 EXP, the custom spells &lt;a href=\"Melectar%27s%20Spell%20Regeneration\"&gt;Melectar's Spell Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20to%20Acid\"&gt;Blood to Acid&lt;/a&gt;, and the magical amulet &lt;a href=\"Avernus%20Ward\"&gt;Avernus Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nA tutor next to a puddle of slime on the walkway linking the Rune Room and the Navigator's Room begs for your assistance in restoring the former student to their former self, which requires a Scroll of &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Curse\"&gt;Remove Curse&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Necklace%20of%20Form%20Stability\"&gt;Necklace of Form Stability&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gains you 2,000 EXP and three scrolls bearing three new custom spells; the level 8 spells &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Forceful%20Hammer\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Forceful Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tereledra%27s%20Pocket%20Army\"&gt;Tereledra's Pocket Army&lt;/a&gt;, and the level 3 spell &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Intangible%20Filter\"&gt;Otiluke's Intangible Filter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Melicamp\"&gt;Melicamp&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the Bastion, and he proudly proclaims that he has abandoned his former teacher &lt;a href=\"Thalantyr\"&gt;Thalantyr&lt;/a&gt; to become a &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Wizard\"&gt;Cowled Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. If the player describes Thalantyr as a wise and capable teacher, the indignant Melicamp will teleport away. If they ask what Melicamp is doing here, he will explain he is studying the cursed bracers that turned him into a chicken back in Baldur's Gate, asserting he can undo their magic. Although Gorion's Ward warns that he's making a dangerous gamble, Melicamp won't be dissuaded and tries his spell. Naturally, it goes wrong and he is turned into a chicken again, and is reduced to asking Gorion's Ward to send for Thalantyr via his tutor, who can be found in the Welcome Room. Once the tutor has been spoken to, return to Melicamp and speak to him; Thalantyr will teleport in and, after some polite discussion, take Melicamp back to Baldur's Gate to cure him and try to knock some sense into him. The party will receive 50,000 EXP; in dialogue, Thalantyr will claim to give Gorion's Ward some Netheril scroll-relics he discovered, but these do not appear in the player's inventory. The item codes referenced in the dialogue (\"Psqevis\" and \"Psqkcf\") do not refer to any actual items. They may be some of the custom spells cut from the Extended Version of the mod.\nIn the Navigator's Room, the player will find a number of apprentices, led by Assistant Scott, and a Cowled Wizard named \"The Professor\". If the player speaks to the Professor, he explains he intends to open a portal to Sigil, and he cannot be dissuaded from this, instead casting his spell. This results in Assistant Scott and three apprentices being apparently gruesomely killed, whereupon a narrator asserts that in fact they have actually been transported elsewhere in the multiverse, but you will need to wait for a new version to find out where, and suggesting that you email the mod's creator. This is apparently one of the questlines from the original version of this mod that was never finished. The party gains 525 EXP for each of the four casualties, for a total of 2,100 EXP.\nThere is also a somewhat hidden Astral Projection of a Mage figure named \"Inferno\", apparently from Sigil. This projection is only found if you explore the shadowy side passages just before the bridge in the caverns. Speak with the projection, and later, after 24 hours or three resting cycles have passed, speak with him again for new dialogue options. Depending on what you choose to say to Inferno, you could have an epic fight with this creature, and gain a powerful item if victorious. You could also be destroyed by a unique Spell called \"Abyssal Fury\". Inferno's projection is worth 25,000 XP. Inferno is highly resistant to many forms of damage, even without spells or buffs. He also likes to cast a dangerous bolt of electricity or two. \nAbout a week or so after owning the Planar Sphere, and having completed all of the initial quests inside, if you enter your stronghold an apprentice will tell you that the spere has been invaded by a band of plundering adventurers. But not to worry, as you have some dialogue with the unwanted interlopers, a group of your apprentices' teleport in to assist you. Unfortunately, they botch their spell casts and hurt or kill themselves, much to the amusement of the outlaw band. It is now up to you to defeat these evil adventurers. \nLater on, maybe a week later, if you visit your Sphere, the attending apprentice greets you again and sounds the alarm that yet another group of invaders seeks to destroy your Stronghold. This time it is a group of Fanatics, who's agenda is to abolish all magic. After some potentially amusing dialogue with the Fanatics, where you can point out that the Fanatics themselves appear to have no problem utilizing magical items in their zeal to destroy magic - there seems to be no way to avoid bloodshed. The group becomes Hostile. Should you defeat them, there is more unique and mundane loot available. The Fanatics are high level and competent melee fighters. \nAfter returning from the Underdark, you might be lucky or unlucky enough to end up battling some enchanted brooms. It depends on who you speak with and the dialogue options. These Brooms are much tougher than battling Mordenkainen's Swords, by far. It could provide significant reward for significant risk."}

{"id": "14878", "revid": "50866439", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14878", "title": "Experience Tables", "text": "The Experience Cap of every game is different. Levels beyond 8,000,000 XP in the main campaign can't be reached. In a total of 8,950,000 XP would theoretically be possible, as the rule defining files exist for such levels, but it's also an experience cap applied at 8,000,000.\nIn the \"Enhanced Editions\", if the &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;protagonist's&lt;/a&gt; experience exceeds certain thresholds at the time &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; first join the party, the exact threshold number of XP will be set to the under-leveled companion for the player to manually level them up instead of the auto-leveling in the classic games. The XP will only be given to the active classes, so &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; characters can actually benefit more. The maximum threshold numbers vary among campaigns.\n If the Siege of Dragonspear expansion is installed, there is a bug with &lt;a href=\"Imoen\"&gt;Imoen&lt;/a&gt;'s script where even if she joins your party after leveling the main character, she won't get an experience boost. \nExperience rewards.\nExperience rewards are by default divided as equally as possible amongst the party members. Any remaining experience is granted in party order. For example, if a gibberling worth 35 XP is killed by a party of four characters, each will gain 8 XP (4 * 8 = 32, with a 3 XP remainder), with the party members in their portraits in the top three positions receiving an additional 1 XP (the remainder of 3, split equally). Thus, over the course of a full game, party members nearer the top portrait slot will accumulate noticeably more experience, though the size of experience rewards means this is more noticeable at lower levels. Note that party members already at the experience cap still consume experience in this way.\nIt is possible for you to miss out on an expected XP reward for a kill when the killing move does not correspond to an ally of yours. A common reason for this is when mind control magic is in play (which is one of the downsides of spells like &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;). A less common reason is that the finishing attack has lost its owner. This can happen when your character dies before the XP is rewarded (double-kill) or when you have hit an opponent with a slow-killing effect (such as &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Acid%20Arrow\"&gt;Melf's Acid Arrow&lt;/a&gt;) and moved to another area before they died. In some cases, traps can lose their owners, too. They will still work for you, but they will no longer reward you with XP for their kills.\n introduced a special reward, dubbed Quest experience. It is named this way because it is only granted as a quest reward. The term quest being a loose term for an event that is not a monster kill and doesn't always update a quest journal entry. It does not mean that all quest rewards that grant experience are quest experience. The log will clearly indicate when quest experience is being rewarded, by listing each member that receives it separately and by using the term.\nQuest experience grants a predetermined amount to each party member. For example, if you have 4 party members and the quest experience is 25,000 the total experience rewarded is 100,000. But for a 6 member party the total will be 150,000. Quest experience by design has no left overs. The disadvantage is that the quest always grants the same amount to a character. Doing a run with fewer party members or even solo will not give you more experience, whereas \"normal\" a.k.a party experience does.\nCreatures - Experience Rewards.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Enemies\"&gt;Enemies&lt;/a&gt; page for a table of creatures and experience rewarded.\nModded games.\nFor modded games with additional adventures or for the EET or BGT mods that enable one continuous game from the trilogy, the experience capping can be immersion breaking and consequently mods have removed or tweaked the tables to adjust them to their purpose.

See &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology\"&gt;Game Terminology&lt;/a&gt; and Exploit for further information.\nAll time exploits.\nExploits were present as of EE v2.3.673 as well as pre-EE games, with a few exceptions. Many of these will not work with more recent versions of the game.\nAny Protagonist Can Have a Familiar.\nTo be able to perform this exploit, it's necessary to play in multiplayer mode (which anyone can do by themselves, despite the name), then:\n-Start the game with a Mage (of the alignment that corresponds to the familiar you want) protagonist with the spell &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Find Familiar&lt;/a&gt; memorized.\n-Cast the spell.\n-Click the \"reform party\" button, delete the Mage character and create another protagonist.\nWith this, any class is able to have a familiar, with the only limitations being that: a) you don't get the bonus HP from casting the spell and b) you can't put the familiar in your bag, as that will make it disappear.\nArmored, Shape Changed and Disabled Spell Casting Trick.\nMages wearing armor can still cast spells via a hotkey. This only works for spells with an AOE target such as &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;; or a ground target such as &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trap\"&gt;Skull Trap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Summoning%20I\"&gt;Animal Summoning&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe same trick also works on shape changes from &lt;a href=\"Shapeshift\"&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It also works with some spells that disable casting such as &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Strength\"&gt;Champion's Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Seeking Sword&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;a href=\"Tenser%27s%20Transformation\"&gt;Tenser's Transformation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wraithform\"&gt;Wraithform&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the spell must have an AOE target such as &lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt; or a ground target such as &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Deva\"&gt;Summon Deva&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttack During Shadowstep.\nA Shadowdancer (or a character using the Rod of Shadowstep) with two different items that increase attacks per round is able to attack during Shadowstep. For example, &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt; in the mainhand and &lt;a href=\"Kundane\"&gt;Kundane&lt;/a&gt; in the offhand; Boomerang Dagger (melee mode, not throwing) in the mainhand and Belm in the offhand; or &lt;a href=\"Ninjat%C5%8D%20of%20the%20Scarlet%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Ninjat\u014d of the Scarlet Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the offhand and &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Extraordinary%20Specialization\"&gt;Gauntlets of Extraordinary Specialization&lt;/a&gt; in the glove slot. Equipping only one of said items doesn't work and neither does equipping one item and applying Haste.\nA character under the effects of Haste gains +1 APR. Under Improved Haste, APR is doubled. \nAll attacks will land regardless of THAC0 because you're under the effect of Time Stop.\nThe character can still backstab during Shadowstep if they are backstab capable.\nOne practical SOA build is to dual class from Shadowdancer to Fighter at level 10, gaining 2 uses of Shadowstep per day. As a fighter, allocate proficiencies into main and off hand weapon styles to reach Specialized for an additional 0.5 APR. Two-Weapon style is optional because it only improves THAC0 which is ignored during Shadowstep. At level 7, a fighter has a base APR of 3/2 while at level 13, a base APR of 2. Dual wielding grants 1 additional APR so to reach 5 APR only 2 proficiency points in your main weapon style is required. With Improved Haste, 10 APR is easily reached during Shadowstep.\nA high-level alternative build is to use a Shadowdancer/Fighter and abuse the save/reload exploit that allows one to cast (Greater) Whirlwind along with other abilities in the same round to be able to: cast Whirlwind, save, reload and use Shadowstep, allowing up to 10 APR during Shadowstep. One may even further abuse the save/reload exploit to Whirlwind, Greater Deathblow and then Shadowstep, for example.\nMoreover, in BG1EE and SoD, a Shadowdancer of at least level 5 (to gain first use of Shadowstep) dualed to a Fighter is able to attack once during Shadowstep if equipped with &lt;a href=\"The%20Chesley%20Crusher\"&gt;The Chesley Crusher&lt;/a&gt; halberd which sets APR to 1.\nIt is also possible to combine this exploit with the &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;cleaving mechanic/bug mentioned in the \"attacks per round\" page&lt;/a&gt; to perform upwards of 13 APR during Shadowstep.\nShadowstep is a class ability and can be replenished with the Replenish Class Special Abilities exploit. This allows the Shadowdancer to remain in Shadowstep perpetually except for a brief window between casts in which an active Shadowstep prevents another from being cast.\nAvoiding/Interrupting Enemy Spells.\nSpells cast by enemy mages can be avoided or interrupted by changing area maps while they cast or the projectile is in the air. For example, if a mage begins casting the &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt; spell and your party is next to a building/area exit, you can change areas and avoid it. There are limitations to this technique, namely that the less number of members in your party, the easier it will be to change areas (and vice versa). It's also easier for spells with a long cast time or slow projectile. For fast spells/projectiles like &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic MIssile&lt;/a&gt;, it can be tricky to do unless using boosts to movement speed, eg &lt;a href=\"The%20Paws%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Paws of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;. \n In the base game, this exploit works particularly well for breaking the AI of enemy assassins using disabling spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Neira\"&gt;Neira&lt;/a&gt;. \nBecome a Fire-spitting Avenger and/or a character capable of using Psionic Blasts.\nTested in BG2EE 2.6, but does not work in BG1EE 2.6.\nTo use these two similar exploits you're gonna need a cursed weapon and a character who can equip them. But the Psionic character exploit also requires a wild mage or some means of getting a wild surge (such as casting spells in an area affected by wild magic). Both exploits can be combined into an Avenger who can spit fire and use psionic blasts, if you want.\nTo perform each exploit follow these steps **exactly**:\na) Fire-spitting Avenger:\n-Equip a cursed weapon, like the Backbiter spear.\n-Try to shapeshift into a Fire Salamander, which will fail, as you can't replace the cursed weapon with the Fire Salamander's spear, however, you'll still be able to use the Fireball Breath attack (which recharges on rest). Your character might appear to have no weapon equipped, however.\n-Try to change weapons via the in-game weapon slots (not in the inventory screen), so that your character will now visually hold the spear again, if they weren't before (do it anyway, just in case).\n-Remove the curse by using temple services or a party member who can cast Remove Curse.\n-You should now be able to use your character freely with any weapon, as a human (or other race), while still maintaining the Fireball Breath ability and its uses will even recharge on rest.\nb) Psionic character:\n-Equip a cursed weapon, like the &lt;a href=\"Backbiter\"&gt;Backbiter&lt;/a&gt; spear or the Two-handed &lt;a href=\"Two-handed%20Sword%2C%20Cursed%20Berserking\"&gt;Sword of Berserking&lt;/a&gt;.\n-**With another character**, cast Shapechange while close to your cursed party member until you get either Wild Surge #6, #48 or #90, so that the spell affects the cursed party member instead of or in addition to the caster. Again, **this must be done with another party member, not the cursed one**.\n-With the cursed party member, try to shapechange into a Mindflayer, which will fail, as you can't replace the cursed weapon with the Mindflayer's natural attack, however, you'll still be able to use the Psionic Blast (which recharges on rest). Your character might appear to have no weapon equipped, however.\n-Try to change weapons via the in-game weapon slots (not in the inventory screen), so that your character will now visually hold the cursed weapon again, if they weren't before (do it anyway, just in case).\n-Rest, so that the Shapechange time runs out. You should still have access to Psionic Blast and should be visually holding the cursed weapon.\n-Remove the curse by using temple services or a party member who can cast Remove Curse.\n-Create a new magical weapon for your cursed party member. Either do this by using a spell like Ghoul Touch, if they can cast spells, or, if they're not spellcaster, use wild magic again to give the cursed party member the created weapon via Wild Surge #6, #48 or #90.\n-Rest, so that the created weapon expires.\n-You should now be able to use your character freely with any weapon, as a human (or other race), while still maintaining the Psionic Blast ability and its uses will even recharge on rest.\nBE AWARE, however, that some kinds of polymorphing/shapeshifting can remove these abilities. So, if that happens, you're going to need to perform the exploit again.\nBlack Blade of Disaster Dual Class Trick.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt; sets Long Sword proficiency to 5 points for the duration of the spell. In BG2EE (verified in v2.6.6), a character that initiates Dual Class under the effect of Black Blade of Disaster permanently retains 5 points in Long Sword proficiency. (Caveat: there appears to be a bug where sometimes the 5 point proficiency bonus is not granted by Black Blade of Disaster. It's unclear why this happens.)\nThis exploit can be combined with an item that produces wild surges, such as The Brick, or a Wild Mage, under wild surges #6, #48 or #90 to apply BBD all party members (See the section on Party-wide self-cast spells), giving any class that initiates a Dual Class 5 points in Long Sword proficiency, although Clerics and Druids cannot make use of long swords without Use Any Item, leaving only a handful of viable combinations, such as Assassin dual class to Mage.\nOne of the problems with this trick is the availability of the Black Blade of Disaster scroll, which only comes in Chapter 6 of Shadows of Amn - probably later than the point a character may want to dual-class, unless the player rushes the main storyline to avoid overlevelling -, combined with the fact Sorcerers can only get the spell at level 18+. With that said, it's possible to access this trick much earlier in the game, without the scroll or a high level Sorcerer, through a certain convoluted method:\nBlack Raven Monastery Trick.\nIn Heart of Fury mode in Icewind Dale 2, you can give your entire party HoF-style bonuses by saving and then loading while one of the characters is in one of the chambers in the monk trials at the Black Raven Monastery. When you reload that save, everyone but the character taking the test will have +10 to all stats, +12 to all levels, and triple HP plus 80 on top (and maybe some AB, AC, and save bonuses). Characters with levels about 24 or so will also be able to level up one last time, adding about 230 levels to any class they currently have no levels in. It's generally best to choose rogue or monk for this last level up, as these classes grant 230d6 sneak attack damage for the rogue and 50 SR, +10 AC, and Stunning Blow and Quivering Palm abilities with save DC's over 100, granting a 95% success rate for each one.\nThere is no way to make these bonuses stack.\nBlind Thief Trick.\n&lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;Thieves&lt;/a&gt; cannot hide or set traps when enemies are near. However, this only applies to the thief's field of vision. A blind thief has a restricted field of vision and can therefore hide in plain sight like a &lt;a href=\"Shadowdancer\"&gt;Shadowdancer&lt;/a&gt; or even set traps in the middle of combat, provided that no enemies are directly next to him or her.\nBefore EE, thieves could hide when blind even when enemies were near, but not set traps (though this may be a testing error).\nThe blind thief trick will even allow you to save or rest in the presence of enemies, though combat must have ended.\nIn BG2EE, there are at least 3 ways to apply the blindness status without duration:\nCasting a single higher level spell than you're supposed to with a Simulacrum clone.\nTested with a Shaman using Vhailor's Helm. As of a later patch, this is not longer possible except with spells that have no cast time such as Spell Immunity, Nahal's Reckless Dweomer, etc.\nSimulacrums clones are level-drained on spawn and, as such, might lose access to some spell levels that your original character has access to (e.g., a Sorcerer can cast spells of level 9, but their Simulacrum clone can't); however, if you pause the game immediately after creating the clone or enable the auto-pause after spell is cast option, you'll notice that the clone will still have access to some of those higher level spells, as the game seems to progressively \"drain\" spell casts instead of getting rid of them at once.\nSo if you create a clone and pause the game quickly you can begin to cast one of those higher level spells that the Simulacrum clone isn't supposed to have access to. But, afterwards, the spell selection will be as normal for a clone, so this really only works for a single cast.\nCasting Infinite Spells with Permanent Alacrity as a Wild Mage.\nIn BG2EE v2.6, Wild Mages can exploit a hotkey for &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; to gain permanent &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; to their spells and cast any number of learned spells (they are still subject to Wild Surges.)\nTo perform this trick, bind a hotkey to &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; and ensure it is memorized at least twice. Press the hotkey twice in succession. The toolbar menu showing spells granted by &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; needs to be open when you press the hotkey the second time. Now cast any spell from the toolbar menu and the menu should not disappear, allowing you to cast infinite spells. All spells cast this way still have casting time but have no casting delay between spells.\nThis trick works with clones, notably Mislead clones created by the Wild Mage despite Mislead preventing the casting of spells.\nCasting Infinite Spell Immunity with Permanent Alacrity.\nSimilar to the above trick, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; has a toolbar menu that can be exploited to apply spell immunity for all types, e.g. Invocation, Divination, etc. Bind a hotkey to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; and memorize at least two instances of Spell Immunity. Cast Spell Immunity twice, making sure the toolbar menu is open before casting it the second time. The menu should not disappear and you will be able to cast all types with alacrity.\nThis trick works with clones, notably Mislead clones despite Mislead preventing the casting of spells. Spell Immunity: Divination is especially useful for preventing clones from being dispelled.\nCasting Infinite Summon Spirit Animals with Permanent Alacrity.\nSimilar to the above trick, in EE, the Totemic Druid ability, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt;, uses a toolbar menu to select a spirit animal type to summon. This ability does not have a listed hotkey but can be cast twice in succession with the help of an AI script. Using your favorite script editor (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;NearInfinity&lt;/a&gt;), create a script with the following:\nWith party AI turned on, assign this script to your Totemic Druid. Clicking 'd' will cast &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt;. Ensure you can cast &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt; at least twice. Cast &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt; and once the spirit animal type selection toolbar menu is shown, cast it a second time. You should now be able to cast infinite spirit animals without casting delay between. You are still subject to summon limits.\nMost spirit animals have attacks that count as +6 weapons; it's not clear if this buff was intended between the original BG2 and BG2EE.\nCharmed Enemy Clones.\nDue to engine limitations, clones (such as those created by &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;) do not get items marked as undroppable. Such items are very often utilized by the developers to attach immunities to creatures, like the &lt;a href=\"DRAGRING.ITM\"&gt;DRAGRING.ITM&lt;/a&gt; item that gives most dragons their basic draconic immunities or the &lt;a href=\"LICH.ITM\"&gt;LICH.ITM&lt;/a&gt; item that gives Liches their Lich-specific immunities.\nSo, what this means is that enemy clones often lack the immunities of their base creatures, making it possible to, say, charm &lt;a href=\"Vongoethe\"&gt;Vongoethe&lt;/a&gt;'s Simulacrum clone or any Lich's Mislead clone with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Command\"&gt;Staff of Command&lt;/a&gt; (that normally can't affect undead with its great no-save charm ability).\nFar more interestingly, however, this means that the player can take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge #6&lt;/a&gt; and #90 (that make any spell target all creatures in an area around the caster) or Wild Surge #48 (that changes the target randomly) to, for example, create a &lt;a href=\"Saladrex\"&gt;Saladrex&lt;/a&gt; Simulacrum clone that lacks draconic immunities, meaning it can be charmed to effectively give you control of a (slightly less powerful) dragon to fight the real thing. Technically-speaking, this could even be used to create a charmable &lt;a href=\"Demogorgon\"&gt;Demogorgon&lt;/a&gt; clone, but one must keep in mind that this \"offensive\" use of Simulacrum and other clone spells is affected by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and, unlike with most dragons, Demogorgon starts the fight hostile, so there's little time to try to roll any of those three Wild Surge outcomes.\nClones.\nClones are copies of the character created via the wizard spells &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt;, or by using &lt;a href=\"Vhailor%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Vhailor's Helm&lt;/a&gt; to cast Simulacrum, or by the Shadowdancer ability &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Twin\"&gt;Shadow Twin&lt;/a&gt;. A character can only have one clone from each spell but clones can clone themselves (no longer possible with Simulacrum in BG2EE 2.6, only with Shadow Twin).\nInnate Abilities.\nClones can use any innate ability the caster possessed at the time of casting. A level 10 clone may still use all of the original level 20 character's HLAs, and a character under the effects of Polymorph Self or Shapechange will generate a clone that can also use those shapeshifting abilities (this no longer appears to be the case in BG2EE v2.6.6). If a Project Image clone shapeshifts, it can even attack while shapeshifted, which Project Image clones are not supposed to be able to do.\nQuick Items Trick.\nWhen a clone is created, it gets a copy of the original character's equipment and quick slot items. The clone can use these items without affecting the originals. This includes scrolls, wands, the special abilities of equipped items, and so on.\nFor example, prior to engaging a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; (or other powerful magic user) a character can load a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20from%20Magic\"&gt;Protection from Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll into a quick slot and then create a clone. The moment the Lich appears, the clone can use the scroll on it, thus preventing the Lich's spell based attacks. Only the clone's copy of the scroll is consumed; the character's original copy remains intact.\nClones created by &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; cannot attack because their APR is set to 0. If the caster equips an item that grants APR before casting &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, the clone will be able to perform attacks.\nTraps.\nThe trap limit of 7 traps per map does not apply to clones. Project Image and Simulacrum clones can lay an unlimited number of traps on any map; however, leaving the area may change the allegiance of the trap so monsters killed by the trap no longer count towards the party or grant experience.\nClone up to 6 Project Images.\nIn BG2EE v2.6.6, a strange new bug allows a character to have up to 6 &lt;a href=\"Project%20Image\"&gt;Project Image&lt;/a&gt; clones at the same time. The price for performing it is the consumption of a Project Image scroll each time. While it is possible to farm infinite Project Image scrolls (see &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random Treasure&lt;/a&gt;) in BG2, the drop-rate is very low, making it impractical.\nTo perform this exploit, memorize at least 1 &lt;a href=\"Vocalize\"&gt;Vocalize&lt;/a&gt; and place a scroll of Project Image and the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; on quick slot. Alternate between 2 different non-self targets with the 6 Wand of Lightning targets (see section Wand of Lightning Trick) then swap the item slot with the Project Image scroll. The character should cast 1 of 6 Project Image then be held by the Project Image spell. (If the animation or combat log show more than Project Image 1 instance being cast, try again and pick different targets further apart from each other.) Using the newest clone, target the held character with all 6 Wand of Lightning targets, then cast Vocalize. The held character will briefly be unheld and cast 1-3 more Project Image instances. Using the newest clone(s), repeat casting Vocalize using the Wand of Lightning trick on the held caster until all 6 Project Image instances are cast. You now have 6 Project Image clones.\nInstead of Vocalize, other self-target spells work as well such as Armor, Ghost Armor, Improved Alacrity, Detect Inivisibility, Time Stop, etc. \nIt is unclear why this exploit works, if there are betters ways to perform it and in which version of BG2EE 2.x was it introduced.\nCones become Novas.\nWhenever a spell or ability shaped like a cone (such as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Hands\"&gt;Burning Hands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Spray\"&gt;Prismatic Spray&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Disciple\"&gt;Dragon Disciple&lt;/a&gt;'s fire breath or even a &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Wand of Frost&lt;/a&gt;'s faux-Cone of Cold) is aimed precisely at its caster, said caster is not facing exactly left or right (any other direction seems fine, down-left, up-right, up, down etc.) and the caster is not walking, the cone will instead turn into a nova, releasing the effect all around the caster.\nThere are two simple ways to \"aim\" precisely at yourself:\n-Cast the spell by targeting the caster's portrait.\n-Cast via &lt;a href=\"Contingency\"&gt;Contingency&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt; with the target 'myself'.\nIf the caster is targeted, but they are facing exactly left or right, then the cone comes out normally, but aimed at the direction opposite the one the caster is facing.\nCursed Weapons and Shapeshift in BG1EE.\nTested in version 2.6.\nBG1EE handles cursed weapons + polymorphing differently compared BG2EE and, instead of preventing the actual polymorph effect from happening, in BG1EE you gain the benefits of polymorph while still attacking with the cursed weapon. So, for example, if you have the &lt;a href=\"Backbiter\"&gt;Backbiter&lt;/a&gt; (spear +3 that damages the user a little bit) equipped as an Avenger and polymorph into a Sword Spider you get the spider's permanent haste effect, its 4 attacks per round etc., but your attacks are still made with the spear, so instead of doing 2d6 damage you'll do 1d6+3 (plus bonuses from weapon proficiency/styles), but also take 3 damage on every hit.\nDrow Gear Safe Delivery Outside the Underdark.\nIn Shadows of Amn, the only area where the game checks for drow gear (to destroy it) is in the Underdark Exit, where you're interrogated by elves. So, to keep drow gear safe from being destroyed, all one needs to do is bypass this area.\nA neutral alignment familiar is commonly used for this purpose, but not many characters can have one (exclusive to Bards, Mages, Thieves with &lt;a href=\"Use%20Any%20Item\"&gt;Use Any Item&lt;/a&gt; and Sorcerer bhaalspawn), so other characters can instead use party members to deliver the gear safely past the area, like this:\n-Leave the gear you want in the Underdark.\n-Go outside and let all the cutscenes play out.\n-Go back into the Underdark and pick up the gear you left on the floor with one party member.\n-Go outside again and pause immediately after the area loads, before any message appears saying the items were destroyed by sunlight.\n-Kick the party member who's holding the drow gear from the party and send them to the Copper Coronet (or whatever other place they go to).\n-Go to the Copper Coronet (or other area) and have them rejoin the party. The drow gear will in their inventory and safe from destruction, as long as you never go to the Underdark Exit with it.\nKeep in mind, however, that the items will still be destroyed once you reach Throne of Bhaal, as the game checks constantly for drow gear when you're in that campaign. But you can at least use them during the rest of Shadows of Amn (good for when you rush to chapter 6 without doing many sidequests) and while going through Watcher's Keep.\nDual Class Proficiency Restriction Bypass.\nWeapon proficiency restrictions are determined by class. For dual class characters, the active class determines the restrictions. For example, when the active class of a Thief/Fighter is Fighter, Grandmastery (5 points) of Long Sword is available. When the active class of a Fighter/Thief is a Thief, only Proficient (1 point) of Long Sword is available.\nIt is possible to bypass the proficiency restrictions of the secondary class by delaying the \"Level Up\" action until the primary class becomes active again. Once this happens, proficiencies gained from the secondary class can be allocated as if it were the primary class.\nAn example is a Kensai who dual classes at level 13 to Thief and avoids the \"Level Up\" action until the Thief reaches level 14. Once reached, the accumulated proficiency points (5 points by level 14) of the Thief can be allocated towards a proficiency as if it were a Kensai, such as reaching Grandmastery of Long Sword by spending 5 points.\nDual Wielding Without Penalties.\nIn BG2EE, holding a magical weapon such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;Flame Blade&lt;/a&gt;, Seeking Sword, &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Blade\"&gt;Phantom Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt;, etc., with an off-hand weapon is not subject to &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Two Weapon&lt;/a&gt; style penalties. Normally, the main/off-hand THAC0 penalty is +4/+8 (0 points), +2/+6 (1 point), +0/+4 (2 points) and +0/+2 (3 points). Dual wielding with a magical weapon is even better than having 3 points in Two Weapon style; it has no THAC0 penalty, +0/+0, on either hands. Even more strange, &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Proficiency\"&gt;Single Weapon&lt;/a&gt; style proficiency applies instead. (There are visual display errors in the inventory and character screen for these stats but can be verified in combat). In summary, the bonuses are:\nDuplicate Items through Import/Export Trick.\nIn multiplayer mode, you can duplicate items by exporting a character with, say, Celestial Fury, then dropping Celestial Fury, going into Character Arbitration, deleting the character, and importing the character you just exported. The character will have an extra copy of Celestial Fury and can pick up the original from the ground. This can duplicate any item besides containers and quest items, as they cannot be exported.\nDuplicate Items when Rasaad Leaves.\nWhen companions leave for quest reasons, they return all quest items in their inventory to the party. In BG2EE, &lt;a href=\"Rasaad%20yn%20Bashir\"&gt;Rasaad&lt;/a&gt;'s script is bugged and he returns quest items twice if convinced to permanently leave the party at the end of his personal questline in SoA. This can used to duplicate items marked with the flag \"Critical Item\", which typically are quest items. This exploit will not work if you dismiss him, he has to leave through this quest.\nItems that have the flag \"Critical Item\" and can be duplicated include but are not limited to:\nWhile you can duplicate containers using this glitch, the contents inside are not duplicated. If you take an item from one container it will take the item from the duplicated container too. This is probably due to how the containers are coded. The content is stored somewhere and the container only serves as a gateway to access it. By duplicating the container, you only dupe the gateway and not the content. Duplicating containers is essentially useless since the original and their copies share the same content but take up additional space.\nDuplicate the Book of Infinite Spells, the Rod of Lordly Might and Ras, the Dancing Blade.\nIn BG2EE, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Infinite%20Spells\"&gt;Book of Infinity Spells&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Lordly%20Might\"&gt;Rod of Lordly Might&lt;/a&gt; can be duplicated by equipping them to a character which can cast Simulacrum. While the item is on the Simulacrum, change the mode of the item to the one that creates a new version of it (i.e., turning the pages with the book or creating a weapons with the rod), then kill the Simulacrum. The item will be found on the corpse of the Simulacrum.\nSimilarly, &lt;a href=\"Ras%2C%20The%20Dancing%20Blade\"&gt;Ras, the Dancing Blade&lt;/a&gt; can also be duplicated by activating the sword's ability with a Simulacrum clone, waiting for the 4 rounds duration to end, and then killing the clone.\nEE Shapechange Trick.\nIn EE, it's possible to grant a character permanent access to any of the wizard shapeshifts. Basically, you have to shapeshift into the form you want just as the spell's duration is running out. Shapeshifting takes 1.2 seconds, and both spells take tens of rounds to run out, so the timing is difficult (shapeshift continuously to count the rounds). This won't work with the Amulet of Power or Robe of Vecna, and is easier if your character is slowed. The Flail of Ages, Ardulia's Fall, or a jelly attack from another mage can all slow your character. Also, it helps to turn on the Auto-Pause: Spell Cast setting and save your game before the spell is about to run out so you can reload and try again without waiting the full duration.\nThe way it works is that shapeshifting removes and then restores your shapeshifting abilities, but the spell itself removes your shapeshifting powers, without restoring them, after x number of seconds have passed. But if you shapeshift after x-1 seconds, you will begin the shapeshift before you lose it, and complete it after the base spell attempts to take it away, which restores your shapeshifting ability.\nThis has limits, however. If you use it to gain permanent access to ogre form via the Polymorph Self spell, you can't gain permanent access to spider form, also from the Polymorph Self spell, without losing the ogre form. This is because the Polymorph Self spell removes the ogre, jelly, flind, spider, wolf, brown bear, and black bear shapeshifts all at once, but you can only carry one of them past the spell duration. Likewise, you can't get permanent access to both Iron Golem and Mind Flayer form, since they both come from Shapechange. You can, however, get an Iron Golem form from Shapechange and a spider form from Polymorph Self.\nThis trick is different from the other permanent shapechange/polymorph self trick that uses wild surges. This trick let's you retain the special abilities to shapechange/polymorph self and return to human form while the other trick eventually removes them but leaves the character transformed. This can be useful for caster classes which need to be able to switch between human form and non-human form or on the protagonist character who initiates dialogue often. (Non-human forms cannot initiate dialogue). That said, both tricks are not mutually exclusive. You can use the wild surge trick to give classes, such as pure warriors and clerics, who normally don't have access to shapechange/polymorph self the ability to transform then apply this trick to let them permanently retain those abilities to transform back and forth between forms.\nIn Shadows of Amn, purchasing &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Wish\"&gt;Limited Wish&lt;/a&gt;, obtainable early from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Yuth\"&gt;Lady Yuth&lt;/a&gt;, and selecting the \"I wish to be anything I desire.\" (Wisdom \u2265 6) choice can permanently grant a single shapechange form to a character. Most shapechange abilities are extremely powerful at all stages of SOA. The Mind Flayer's attack to devour intelligence can be used to kill difficult enemies such as liches. The mind flayer also has an area-of-effect psionic blast ability that refreshes each time the caster shapechanges into the mind flayer, essentially granting an infinitely repeatable hold spell every 2 rounds. The Greater Wolfwere regenerates 8hp/sec and 16hp/sec under haste, making it a formidable damage sponge. Lastly, the Iron Golem is immune to most elemental types and resistant to physical damage. Its attack deals a whooping 4d10 + strength bonus and can be used to backstab. Thus, a thief can permanently gain Iron Golem and human forms at the beginning of SOA and become a backstabbing juggernaut.\nBefore EE, there is a simpler method involving killing the character in question (see Shapechange Trick in classic section below).\nExceeding the summon limit.\nThe summon limit only applies to characters in your party and their clones, so you can have more than 5 regular summons (or more than 1 special summon like Planetars), by:\na) Summoning creatures with charmed enemies; or\nb) Removing a party member, charming them and then casting a bunch of summoning spells (or using summoning items), before adding the character back to the party.\nExtra Attacks Per Round (breaking the 10 APR barrier).\nThe fabled \"Cleave\" mechanic talked about since the original Baldur's Gate is none other than an AI scripting bug, sad to say. This trick is easy to perform and isn't restricted to killing blows. In fact, it applies to any character at any level that enables certain scripts when Party-AI is active. Non-hasted characters can reach 5 APR and hasted characters can reach upward of 13 APR rivaling the the Whirlwind ability.\nA character's round is reset with certain AI scripts when it selects a target (new or same). A round reset makes the character perform attacks as if it were a new round even if previously in the middle of one. Many actions cause a script to select a target such as the target dying (giving the illusion of Cleaving), after casting a spell, changing weapons, etc. Most actions have a delay before targeting occurs. The shorter the delay, the quicker the character reacts to attack. Some of the actions with the shortest delay are:\nThe easiest way to perform this trick is to assign a character the Advanced AI (enable Attack Enemies and disable all other options) and equip a weapon with low &lt;a href=\"Speed%20Factor\"&gt;Speed Factor&lt;/a&gt;, such as daggers, throwing darts, &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Allow the AI script to target an enemy and after each attack animination cause the character to re-target by performing one of three actions above that cause the AI script to select a target. The enemy reticle will go from targeted to untargeted back to targeted. If performed correctly, the character's round will reset and they will attack almost immediately. Repeat this each time the animation lands a hit or would land a hit but misses. \nTo achieve beyond 10 APR requires: \nExtra Speed Weapons.\nIn the most recent version of EE, magical throwing daggers can be dual-wielded provided that the throwing dagger is kept in the main hand and used as a melee weapon (not as a throwing weapon). Since throwing daggers grant +1 APR even when used as melee weapons, they function as additional speed weapons alongside Belm, Kundane, and the Ninja-to of the Scarlet Brotherhood. In BG2EE, the &lt;a href=\"Boomerang%20Dagger\"&gt;Boomerang Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firetooth%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;Firetooth (dagger)&lt;/a&gt; can be used to gain an extra +1 APR. \nIn the original BG2, there was another speed weapon: the Shadow Thief Dagger, which you can only get by siding with Bodhi and opting for the \"unseemly task\" for your second assignment, and which you can only keep by returning to Bodhi to report that you spared the target's life. The Shadow Thief Dagger (STD) sets your APR to 2 rather than increasing it by 1, so it's especially effective in the hands of Project Image clones, but it gets no Strength bonus. However, unlike other speed weapons, it is non-magical and can bypass &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;PFMW&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamiliar and Charmed Thieves' Use Any Items Trick.\nA ferret or cat familiar, or a charmed thief, can pickpocket party members to obtain any usable item (whether they normally go in the quick item slot or not, so anything from potions and scrolls to the Helm of Brilliance) and, after resting or saving/reloading, that item will appear on their quick item slot and be usable, no matter the item's class restriction.\nClasses with ferret or cat familiars can easily make use of this, but any other class (except Wizard Slayers) can utilize items like the Nymph Cloak or the Ring of Human Influence to charm a thief and pickpocket a powerful scroll from the party to use in a coming battle, for example, when there are no spellcasters or thieves with Use Any Item in the party. Or this can simply allow a solo character (without access to scrolls) to cast Limited Wish for an early Full Plate +2 or to start the Limited Wish quest, for example.\nFarming summoned Cacodemon, gated Demon.\nGated demons provide experience, so they can be summoned and farmed for experience in a safe environment by players who know those spells.\nEE 2.6 Update: Any summoned creature, or gated creature in the game files that has assigned \"experience points for kill\" in that associated field within the .CRE file will provide experience points when the creature is killed. The game is very inconsistent with this assigned XP value. Some examples: A gated Pit Fiend provides no XP for a kill (DEMPITSU.CRE). A summoned Hobgoblin Elite from the summon spell or wand of summoning also provide no XP. A Deva, Planetar, Fallen Deva or Fallen Planetar do provide XP. It is, unfortunately a broken exploit. The game clearly did not intend for the player to summon a Deva and then kill it's own allied creature to gain experience. The Deva, for example, will not even become hostile while you farm it for XP. Maybe this will be taken care in the upcoming BG2EE Fixpack. \nFatigue Removal.\nKicking a character out of the party and bringing them back in will reset their fatigue to 0.\nFerret/Cat Smuggling.\nA ferret or cat familiar can pickpocket party members. If you use it to pickpocket the Rift Device, you can smuggle it out of the sewers without triggering the instant death script and then talk to the familiar to give it back to you. This can also work with drow equipment, which is supposed to disintegrate when you leave the Underdark, but the game does not check the ferret or cat's inventory for the items; only yours.\nThe Rift Device has the power to reduce the HP of any NPC in the game to 1, and can be used by any class on any target. This will automatically trigger events for bosses that need to be reduced to 1 HP or less, bypassing the formality of battling them.\nFire Giant XP Loop.\nBy placing archers close to the walls of Saradush and either using the vanilla game's Guard function (see Guarding with Ranged Weapons) or applying the right AI script, your archers can shoot Fire Giants just beyond the walls, out of sight, and yield XP at no risk.\nFire Seeds Trick.\nWeapons that use area-effect projectiles can apply on-hit effects to more than one enemy at a time. This bypasses weapon immunities and all forms of spell protections. Thus, a character can use any of the following weapons:\nTo apply any of the following effects:\nTo any group of creatures, provided the initial target is not immune to the weapon. Throwing a Fire Seed will fail against a mage with &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;PFMW&lt;/a&gt; active, but it can hit the mage if you target a nearby character without PFMW.\nFire Seeds and Cloak of the Stars Stockpiling.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seeds\"&gt;Fire Seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dart%20%2B5\"&gt;Dart +5&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Cloak of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; are temporary and disappear after a few hours. To stockpile them, drop them on the ground or place them in a container, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Dragomir%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dragomir's Respite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt;, then rest. Resting will cause the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seeds\"&gt;Fire Seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dart%20%2B5\"&gt;Dart +5&lt;/a&gt; to skip the trigger which removes them, letting you stockpile.\nTo expedite the stockpiling of &lt;a href=\"Dart%20%2B5\"&gt;Dart +5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; trick can be used to create 6 times the number of darts. These darts can be sold to a merchant in a pinch for a few hundred gold.\nNote: This functions differently in BG2:EE. With testing on the Nintendo Switch version, all that was necessary to keep &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seeds\"&gt;Fire Seeds&lt;/a&gt; was to put them in an &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Belt\"&gt;Ammo Belt&lt;/a&gt; until the spell's duration expires, with no resting required. This makes it fairly effortless to stockpile these if one simply keeps them stored in the belt at all times. By contrast, stacks of &lt;a href=\"Dart%20%2B5\"&gt;Dart +5&lt;/a&gt; stored in an &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Belt\"&gt;Ammo Belt&lt;/a&gt; will become buggy after the expiration time hits, and will ultimately disappear. It is still possible to stockpile these darts, but it requires significantly more maintenance as it involves refreshing their expiration timer by placing old stacks onto new stacks. See the &lt;a href=\"Dart%20%2B5\"&gt;Dart +5&lt;/a&gt; page for more details.\nFireshield Hot Potato.\nWith changes in BG2EE v.2.6, two casters both with &lt;a href=\"Fireshield\"&gt;Fireshield&lt;/a&gt; will exchange damage in a very long loop when striking each other in melee. If a caster does not have 100% resistance to fire for &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; or cold for &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Blue%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; they will likely die. If a caster has more than 100% resistance, they will likely be fully healed.\nThese changes to Fireshield give casters a way of quickly killing other casters of Fireshield who do not have enough resistance.\nOver 100% fire resistance can be achieved with &lt;a href=\"Batalista%27s%20Passport\"&gt;Batalista's Passport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection from Fire&lt;/a&gt; or passives from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Disciple\"&gt;Dragon Disciple&lt;/a&gt; class.\nIf an enemy doesn't have Fireshield, you can forcefully apply it on them with wild surges #6 and #90, which give all creatures in a small area the effects of the spell. A wild surges from a Wild mage or an item will do. While it's tedious to roll exactly these wild surges, unless the enemy has high fire resistance, they will be one-shotted when you attack them.\nFog of War Trick.\nTechnically, this exploit relates to line of sight, but it's often referred to as &lt;a href=\"Fog%20of%20War\"&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt;. Some enemies will not react if they suffer damage when the player's characters or summons are not in sight. Thus, you can use AOE spells to attack enemies without them retaliating.\nHere's an example use of this trick. A &lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage /\u00a0Thief&lt;/a&gt; scouts out an area to find a cluster of stationary enemies and then:\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;Staff of the Magi&lt;/a&gt; is obtained, this trick can be performed more efficiently since there's no need to wait on the stealth cooldown, as the staff's wielder can simply unequip/re-equip the staff to restore invisibility.\nGhoul Touch.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Touch\"&gt;Ghoul Touch&lt;/a&gt; is a Level 2 Necromancy Spell that gives a Wizard (or Priest) the ability to paralyze with a touch, but do nothing else. Flaming Fist Battle Wizards often use it as a last resort, and killing them after they've cast Ghoul Touch reveals that the Ghoul Touch hand was accidentally flagged as a drop-able item in Baldur's Gate, so it is almost like being able to equip the rigid hand of the deceased Flaming Fist. Party members who die while using Ghoul Touch will also exhibit this phenomenon.\nAlthough interesting, Ghoul Touch is not a useful weapon even if it can be equipped, as it is treated as a mace and Wizards do not have any proficiency in it. However, if the character is exported to Baldur's Gate II and allowed to bypass the inventory wipe in the Irenicus Dungeon (only available in multiplayer), they will retain the Ghoul Touch in one of their primary weapon slots where it is an effective weapon, capable of dealing damage alongside paralyzing an opponent without time limit. However, it is easily dispelled and is less potent as the game increases in difficulty.\nGuarding with Ranged Weapons.\nA character guarding a target retaliates against attackers of said target. Typically, guarding characters move close to the guarded, however if they are equipped with a ranged weapon, they will still retaliate against attackers at a great distance (about two or one-and-a-half screens away seems to be the maximum range), across the fog-of-war and barriers such as walls if the target is currently getting attacked (otherwise the guarding character will try to move towards their target).\nOne can more easily separate the guarding character from the guarded by making the guarding character over-encumbered or by closing doors, removing any path to the guarded. However, that is unecessary for the exploit to actually work, as, once again, if the target is already getting attacked, the character will use its ranged weapon and only move in a bit closer if outranged with this new much greater range (which means the 'convenience' of encumberance might also prevent the exploit to work, if the character and target are excessively far from each other, in an immense area).\nTo summarize, a ranged weapon wielder need only chose to guard someone who is getting attacked and they will do so from up to a far greater distance than normal (more or less two screens or one-and-a-half screens away), beyond line of sight and through walls. If they choose to guard someone not currently under attack, they will simply move next to them, as normal.\nHelmet of Opposite Alignment.\nUnlike in the original BG, in BGEE the Demon Knight will simply drop this helmet when killed (making exploits to acquire it unnecessary). However, the old trick of simply equipping both this Helmet and the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity and removing the curse to permanently alter your character's alignment won't work (unless extra steps are taken). There are two ways to achieve permanent alignment change in the current EEs:\nFirst, you may cast remove curse, pause the game and check that the items are removed and back in the character's inventory. There will be a small window of time when the items are removed, but the effects are still applied to the character. Place the helm back on the character and allow the spell to resolve. They will have the original gender and alignment, but wearing the cursed helmet. A second remove curse will remove the item and \"restore\" the character to the opposite alignment permanently.\nAnother, perhaps, easier/more convenient way (doesn't require precise timing) to permanently alter your alignment with this helmet is to reproduce these exact steps (tested in BGEE version 2.6 with a Blackguard and a Cleric of Talos):\n-Equip the Helmet of Opposite Alignment, followed by the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity. Your alignment should, as intended, be the opposite of what it originally was.\n-Acquire enough experience to level up but do not actually level up, nor change area or save/reload (if you do it before finishing the steps it won't work!). Check your alignment. You should now have your original alignment despite the fact you're still wearing the cursed helmet (and the belt).\n-Cast or have someone else cast Remove Curse on your character. Your alignment should now be permanently changed.\nTo be clear: for some reason, your alignment reverts back to its original state as soon as you acquire enough xp to level up while wearing both cursed items and that allows the Remove Curse spell to \"revert\" your alignment the wrong way around, just like in the classic exploit.\nYet another way to perform this trick, but this time in a way that's available for characters who already reached the level cap in BGEE, is the following:\n-Equip the Helmet of Opposite Alignment, followed by the Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity. Your alignment should, as intended, be the opposite of what it originally was.\n-Proceed with the character to BG2EE (either import immediately or after beating BGEE, it doesn't matter).\n-When the game starts and your equipment is taken, your character's original gender will be restored, but the alignment will remain changed.\nIn theory, the above trick works by exporting/importing back into BGEE and then having the curse removed, but this path has little practical purpose.\nHexxat Stun Trick.\nHexxat is immune to nearly all disablers except for &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word: Stun&lt;/a&gt;. The effect interferes with her mist form script, so you can hit her with PW: Stun while she's wounded and she will remain stunned but still invincible thanks to her MINHP1 item.\nImmune to Polymorph Grants Polymorph Weapon while Staying as Human Form.\nIn BG2EE v.2.6, when trying to Shapechange, Polymorph or change forms while under an effect that grants \"Immune to Polymorph\", the character remains in their current 'human' form but keeps the form changed weapon, i.e. you stay in human form but retain the weapon of say an Iron Golem.\nThis means the human form character can cast spells, talk with other characters and stay as a small character model that doesn't get stuck in doorways. \nUnfortunately, very few items or events grant \"Immune to Polymorph\", e.g., Drow form, granted by &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imoen%27s%20Belt\"&gt;Imoen's Belt&lt;/a&gt;, wild surge polymorph: wolf and &lt;a href=\"Hexxat%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Hexxat's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; when in mist form. Also, dual-classing while under the effects of any form change reverts back to 'human' form but only briefly until an action is taken.\nInvincible Barbarians and Undead Hunters.\nThe level 4 arcane spell Otiluke's Resilient Sphere makes a character immune to every spell level, every school of magic, every magical and non-magical weapon, gives them 100% Magic Resistance and immunity to every kind of damage, however, it also sets that character's attacks per round to 0, reduces their movement speed to 0 and holds them with a rarely-used hold effect called &lt;a href=\"Hold%20creature%202\"&gt;Hold creature 2&lt;/a&gt; that's otherwise only used in Hold Undead and a few traps, to bypass normal hold immunity.\nBut Barbarians and Undead Hunters can get around two of those three negative effects while taking full advantage of the protective effects of Otiluke's Sphere. The character can attack or cast spells, is impervious to damage and almost everything else, and is only unable to walk around:\nFinally, at least in &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s, not all effects from the sphere seem to be applied. 100% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; and immunity to spell levels 1 to 9/10 are missing, but other effects of Otiluke's Sphere ensure that almost all magic will simply not go through at all.\nInvincible Level 1 Tanks.\nLevel 1 characters cannot die in one hit unless they have 14 HP or higher. They will resist any damage by enough to reduce them to exactly 1 HP (at which point further damage will kill them). This mechanic was included even in the original Baldur's Gate and has carried through into the Enhanced Editions, and applies at all difficulty levels. The fact that level 1 characters can't die in a single hit seems intended to prevent player frustration at being killed so easily, so early into the game. However it resulted in an unintended side effect, which admittedly can be difficult to pull off: level 1 characters who only have a maximum of 1 HP cannot die from damage, as the game cannot reduce their HP to any fraction of the total.\nThe easiest way to accomplish this in older versions was to play or recruit a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; with 3 &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; (as other races have higher constitution minimums). Then buy and equip &lt;a href=\"The%20Claw%20of%20Kazgaroth\"&gt;The Claw of Kazgaroth&lt;/a&gt; which reduces constitution by 2. Your level 1 mage will now have a maximum of 1 HP and will resist all damage.\nIn the Enhanced Editions, it is significantly easier to set this up: again play a human mage with 3 constitution, but then cast the &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Find Familiar&lt;/a&gt; spell and kill your own familiar. This will reduce your maximum constitution by 1. Rest and repeat this to get your maximum HP down to 1.\nThere is a bug with this mechanic: any attacks dealing the character's maximum HP exactly will kill them, which means with a maximum of 1 HP, the character can still die if an attack deals 1 HP.\nInvincible Level-Drained Shamans.\n&lt;a href=\"Favored%20of%20the%20Spirits\"&gt;Favored of the Spirits&lt;/a&gt; gives Shamans (among other things) the rare \"minimum hp\" effect and sets it to 1, meaning they cannot have their hp reduced below 1 for as long as the effect lasts (50 rounds, in this case). However, the way this ability works is that, if the Shaman's hp gets to the 10% threshold or under it, the effect is removed and they get a full heal. Knowing this, one can exploit this ability by making it impossible to have less than 10% hp, via having 9 or under maximum hp (1hp is more than 10% of 9).\nTo achieve that with a level 19 Shaman (the earliest level that one can acquire Favored of the Spirits), one needs to be level-drained, due to the fact the game's engine has a limitation: you cannot have less maximum hp than your character level (so a level 19 Shaman cannot have less than 19 maximum hp). Therefore, we need to be level 9 (and, yes, &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt; remain available to you, even when you're level-drained).\nBeyond that, another way to help lower your maximum hp is to become a squirrel, via &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Other\"&gt;Polymorph Other&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Polymorphing\"&gt;Wand of Polymorphing&lt;/a&gt;, because the squirrel form is supposed to set a character's maximum hp to 5, but due to the aforementioned engine limitation, we still need to be level-drained down to 9.\nIn summary, one way to perform this trick is to:\n-Reach level 19 as a Shaman to acquire Favored of the Spirits.\n-Get level-drained down to, at least, level 9 and get turned into a squirrel.\n-Cast Favored of the Spirits to become, essentially, invincible for 50 rounds (though, technically, you can still die from stat-drain, like from a Mindflayer draining your intelligence down to 0).\nBesides serving as a tank for 50 rounds, it's worth mentioning that this level-drained invincible shaman squirrel can still dance to produce an infinite amount of Major Animal Spirits, who (due to having 3 attacks per round) might still be able to hit some high level monsters by getting critical hits here and there. So if you're not planning on summoning anything else, it's better than nothing.\nItem Duplication.\nYou can duplicate items using a shop or a bag of holding. First, you need at least two (or possibly three) copies of the item you want to duplicate. Sell one copy to a shop, exit out of the shop, and then go back to the shop's menu. Purchase the item back, but instead of clicking \"Done,\" click the inventory button on the left side of the screen, twice. You will then return to the game screen, at which point you can re-enter the shop.\nIf you do this repeatedly, you can create an unlimited number of copies of the item, as skipping the \"Done\" button prevents the shop from deleting its own supply. Thus, you can always buy another copy. Using a bag of holding works the same way, but costs nothing.\nItem Swapping for Disabled Characters.\nIn the IE games, you cannot access a disabled or charmed character's inventory, but EE allows you to add items to their inventory slots, but not remove them. However, you can force a disabled character to let go of an equipped item if you replace it. For example, if you need to land an Arrow of Dispelling to cure a feebleminded party member, but are wearing Boots of Avoidance and therefore have +5 to AC vs. missiles, you can place an extra pair of boots on the character's boot slot to remove them and make it easier to land the Arrow of Dispelling.\nKilling Powerful NPCs.\nDrizzt Do'Urden.\nIf Drizzt can be surrounded by NPC party members (it will take a full party of CHARNAME plus the 5 NPCs and can be a bit tricky to accomplish as he wanders hasted) and then Reform until all former members become neutral, his attack will be limited to close-range melee. In that situation, Drizzt can be killed with either a ranged or long-range melee weapon with total safety for the CHARNAME. Only natural 20 rolls will hit him and none of those will register as critical hits since Drizzt is immune to those. A sizable reputation loss will result from his death.\nIt is also possible to play tag with Drizzt around the lake, using the Boots of Speed to evade his strikes. Drizzt's pathfinding in Baldur's Gate is not that great and he can get stuck in the middle of the lake, with the player on the other side. For wizards, using Dimension Door to cross the lake is advised. The player can then pepper him with arrows or ranged spells with impunity until he dies.\nIf you move very carefully towards Drizzt, the Gnolls will start attacking him while Drizzt himself is still out of range. This way he does not start his script, does not defend himself and will eventually be killed by the Gnolls\u2019 occasional natural 20 hits. (Not Working on Nintendo Switch)\nUlraunt.\nUlraunt is very killable but has high physical resistance to weapons and a high magic resistance, like a human Kangaxx. Players will have to attack him for a long, long time (or get lucky with the Dagger of Venom) but he will eventually die by normal means.\nGorion (Prologue).\nHe casts a number of Level 3 spells but autokills any enemy he targets with the spell once it is cast. Stay out of his line of sight and use spells like Cloudkill or Stinking Cloud to pacify him from a distance, then awaken him with offensive spells, arrows or melee. The best option possible is to bounce a lightning bolt off the stairs so it hits him multiple times.\nTethtoril (Prologue).\nPossesses Deity Kill, which is as unstoppable as Gorion's instant-kill command, but Diety Kill has a weakness: it is lower than Level 3, and is blocked by Minor Globe of Invulnerability. Use a globed Wizard to soak up Tethtoril's attention while attacking him with whatever other weapons (preferably the Dagger of Venom) are at hand.\nShandalar.\nSingle most powerful NPC/boss in Tales of the Sword Coast, in terms of difficulty and experience given (24,000 EXP). He casts a number of Level 5/6 spells with Improved Alacrity after casting Globe of Invulnerability on himself, eventually teleporting away when he's out of ammo. Attack him from a distance using area spells, Cloudkill, Stinking Cloud or wands, casting Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on him and punching him out with fists, finishing him off with melee or the Dagger of Venom. Can also be paralyzed with a wand, it might take a lot of reloads.\nWatchers (Prologue).\nKilling them gives immediate access to plate armor, so even for players of good alignment, killing one can be valuable as plate armor is difficult to find early in the game.\nKilling without Losing Reputation.\nYou can kill a character without losing reputation by using a cursed scroll of monster summoning on them. You can also charm them and make them kill themselves with offensive spells, though not all characters have such spells. This can let you avoid reputation loss when killing characters with valuable items such as Firebead Elvenhair, Ordulinian, Noralee, Dushai, and Shandalar's daughters.\nA second way to kill a civilian without reputation loss is to land a killing hit using missile weapons by a companion who is temporarily booted from the party. When the arrow or throwing knife etc. is still in midair, reform the group by removing that companion. If the civilian is killed by that arrow or knife, no penalty will be incurred.\nA third way to kill civilian or even plot-important npc without reputation loss or turning other npc hostile involves a cleric companion who is able to cast lv.1 sanctuary and lv. 6 blade barrier. Align your cleric companion close to your killing target, and move your player character next to your cleric. Cast sanctuary and then blade barrier. Dismiss your cleric immediately and the cleric will initiate dialogue with your PC. Order the cleric to stay in the current position. After that, you can relax and enjoy your target being struck down by the blade of a third party person. If your cleric has HLA globel of blades, it is even better which can stack with the blade barrier to improve the damage. The above way allows damaging most of the plot-important npc without triggering their instant kill scripts when turned hostile. For example, attacking Bodhi or Irenicus prematurely. Yet, it still cannot bypass the HPMIN=1 enchantment that often exits on these npc.\nIn case that your cleric companion doesn't allow the option to stay at the current position when you dismiss him/her, here is a workaround. Once you have your cleric standing next to the killing target, you need to entrap your cleric with three summons by surrounding him/her. Once you dismiss your cleric, he/she will be stuck at the current location while trying to reach your PC to initiate dialogue. The summons can be Simulacra of mage that can cast spell immunity evocation or a Simulacrum that has 3 scroll of magic protection. Such that you can use normal summons with magic protection to tank the blade barrier.\nNote that some plot-important npc when killed will turn all allied npc hostile to your party even though your party is \"legitimately\" innocent or not involved with it. For example, Solaufein or Phaere in underdark for SoA, the ogre general from the Caelar faction during your infiltration to their camp for SoD.\nLearning spells from prohibited schools and adding spells from scrolls as a sorcerer.\nA specialist mage dualed into a thief and a multiclass illusionist/thief gnome are able to equip scrolls from their prohibited schools into quick item slots and use them, but still cannot normally scribe them into their spellbook. Meanwhile, sorcerers have no prohibited schools, but cannot ordinarily learn spells from scrolls at all. However it's possible to do so in both cases, by: equipping a multi-mode item such as Wand of Fire or Book of Infinite Spells in a quick item slot, changing it to its secondary ability (e.g. Scorcher or \"turn a page\"), using it and immediately pausing (before it's actually used), switching the item for a scroll from a prohibited school (or any scroll, in the case of the sorcerer) and, finally, unpausing.\nThis causes the multi-mode item to use its second ability, which, in the case of scrolls, is the \"scribe\" ability that's normally only available via the item description menu.\nLevel 41 Characters.\nWhen a character's XP becomes negative, it underflows into a large positive value. A single or multi class character jumps to their max level, meanwhile, a dual class character with an active secondary class jumps beyond the level cap to level 41. So far, only three events are known to grant negative XP in BG2EE:\nCharacters start SoA with over 75,000 XP, making it difficult to reach any of these 3 events without gaining additional XP. The easiest way to lower a character's XP such that these events causes their XP to become negative is by dual classing. Before performing any of these events, a character should dual classes such that they become level 1 with 0 XP.\nWithout mods, at level 41, some aspects of the class behave unexpectedly:\nOther aspects such as HLAs, proficiency points, turn undead and theving skill points apply normally. Due to this, only a handful Dual Class combinations are useful:\nLevel 41 characters do not appear to regain spell slots, backstab multipliers or THAC0 if afflicted by Level-Drain.\nLightning Bolt Loop.\nA Lightning Bolt spell can bounce off of both the Cloak of Reflection and the original version of the Cloak of Mirroring. By deleting the Cloak of Mirroring's file in the override folder and restoring the original version, which reflects rather than blocks spell damage (may not be possible in EE), or by using the Import/Export Trick to duplicate the Cloak of Reflection you can bounce a Lightning Bolt spell or Wand of Lightning charges between two party members indefinitely. You can even dedicate multiple charges and add extra lightning bolts to the loop, making it stronger.\nTesting has found that the loop can be canceled accidentally due to positioning problems. Testing has also suggested that it is possible to make it impossible for the loop to ever be re-created in a single save game.\nIt's also possible to bounce a Lightning Bolt spell or wand in a reliable path by pointing it directly north or south in close quarters, as lightning bolts bounce directly backwards if cast north or south. This can be used to reliably hit a single target about 5 times in a narrow hallway. But the EE version of the lightning bolt projectile may behave differently.\nLimited Wish-resting.\nWild Mages can use &lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; to cast &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Wish\"&gt;Limited Wish&lt;/a&gt;. Limited Wish allows a caster with high Wisdom to restore spell slots: 1 spell for each level from 1 to 4. If the Wild Mage has no empty level 4 spell slots, it will restore a level 3 spell slot instead. With no empty spell slots, a single Limited Wish, generated from a single Nahal's Reckless Dweomer, can restore 4 level 1 spells slots, allowing a Wild Mage to cast spells indefinitely, provided it does not suffer a wild surge that breaks the loop.\nA wild mage dual cleric can restore upwards of 8 mage and cleric spells (4 mage spells and 4 cleric spells) for levels 1 to 4.\nLimited Wish Dispel.\n&lt;a href=\"Limited%20Wish\"&gt;Limited Wish&lt;/a&gt; can be used to remove buff, debuffs and summons during combat by selecting \"I wish to be protected from undead right now.\" on a character with 9 or less wisdom to move time forward until it is midnight. Depending on the time of day, you may need 2 Limited Wishes to fully dispel all effects. Say the time is 5 minutes to midnight. The first Limited Wish would move time forward by 5 minutes, enough to remove some summons but not all such as &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt;. The 2nd Limited Wish would then move time by almost 24 hours.\nThe wand of lightning trick can be used with Limited Wish to multiply the effect by up to 6 times.\nThe dispel of this trick is global and powerful with the caveat that you need to defeat a group of vampires.\nLimited Wish Vampires.\n&lt;a href=\"Limited%20Wish\"&gt;Limited Wish&lt;/a&gt; can be used to summon vampires during combat by selecting \"I wish to be protected from undead right now.\" on a character with 9 or less wisdom (also see Limited Wish Dispel).\nGood or neutral-aligned Clerics with sufficiently high level turn undead are able to slay the vampires, granting a high, repeatable source of XP.\nEvil-aligned Clerics with sufficiently high level turn undead are able to gain control of vampires rather than slay them outright, giving you a deadly pack of vampires to command.\nLingering Song Trick.\nIn Icewind Dale 2, the Lingering Song trick lets a bard's song continue for 2 rounds after being activated. This allows you to repeatedly click the bard song icon and stack the effects of any song while the game is still paused. The effects scale infinitely, except for the damage bonus from the Ballad of Three Heroes, which is capped at +20.\nMaze: The Ultimate Protection.\nSeveral events in the game apply effects that are normally considered unavoidable, as they have &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; 0 (explicitly targeted by nothing in game) and are considered nonmagical (so protections against magic attacks and magic resistance don't work), such as the CON loss resulting from a Familiar's death or the DEX/CON/INT/WIS loss from the dream sequence with the Demon in Spellhold. However, the spell Maze has the unique property of, essentially, \"temporarily removing characters from the game\", only to bring them back later and, as a result, most effects that happen in an instant can be avoided by simply \"not being there\" during said instant, via Maze,\nFor example, while Mazed, your Familiar can die and you won't suffer a CON loss, not even when you return. And, if you time it right (this one is not so easy to do), you can vanish into the maze after the end of the conversation with the Spellhold Demon, but before the actual stat loss happens, so that it won't affect you; and then you simply have to wait for your character to return from the Maze. This last trick can be done much more easily if you have a Familiar, cause the Familiar can start a conversation with the Demon while you're Mazed.\nThe unfortunate limitation of this exploit is the fact that you get a game over if you're Maze'd as a solo character, so you need at least one (living, not-charmed, not-Maze'd etc.) party member to perform this.\nMaze Trapping.\nWhile not an exploit, a Bounty Hunter can Maze an entire group of enemies using a level 21 Special Snare. This allows the Bounty Hunter to set additional traps while the enemies are gone. When the enemies return--usually one at a time--they will immediately trigger any traps the Bounty Hunter has lain since the first Maze trap. This can be done as long as the Bounty Hunter still has Maze traps.\nMeta Trapping.\nSeveral tough enemies only appear after you take some explicit action (e.g., opening a Lich's sarcophagus, chatting with the &lt;a href=\"Demogorgon\"&gt;Demogorgon&lt;/a&gt;, severing one of &lt;a href=\"Amelyssan\"&gt;Amelyssan's&lt;/a&gt; power sources). By preparing the area with spike traps, you can kill these enemies the moment they appear. To avoid running out of traps in the Amelysaan battle, have a clone lay the traps for you.\nYou can also use this approach on enemies that start out neutral until some explicit action is taken (such as &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt; or the shadow dragon &lt;a href=\"Thaxll%27ssillyia\"&gt;Thaxll'ssillyia&lt;/a&gt;).\nMislead Backstabs.\nAny character under the effects of &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt; is considered constantly invisible for the purposes of backstabbing. Thus, a Misled character can backstab multiple times in a single round, so long as the target does not turn around.\nAlso, if you send the Mislead clone to a safe place (Maze does not count), enemies will not be able to kill it, and so your Misled character will remain completely undetectable, except to enemies who naturally see through invisibility like liches, demons, and dragons, for the duration of the spell.\nMix and match spells of different alignments with divine casters.\nA divine caster (Cleric, Paladin, Blackguard etc.), that permanently changes their alignment via the Helmet of Opposite Alignment exploit before they acquire new spells will acquire those of the alignment they've changed into. So, for example, if one manages to acquire the helmet and reproduce the exploit with a Blackguard they will be able to learn Holy Smite whenever they reach level 3 spells.\nIf you keep changing your alignment back and forth it's even possible to mix and match spells to have, say, level 1 spells from good alignment, level 2 spells from evil alignment, level 3 spells from good alignment and so on. This is especially useful for players using the Sword Coast Stratagems mod that introduces Icewind Dale spells into BGEE and BG2EE, many of which are alignment-restricted. Although players in unmodded games might want to at least give their evil clerics access to Holy Smite, for example.\nFinally, this trick is, unfortunately, not applicable for Druids as they are unaffected by the Helmet of Opposite Alignment (because they're True Neutral).\nMultiplayer Bugs.\nMultiplayer bugs are a class of bugs that require two or more players in the game to perform. With at least two players, certain actions are possible that are not otherwise possible with a single player. For example, being able to cast spells while another player is in the Level Up screen or forcing a cutscene during key moments.\nHaving multiple computers is not a requirement since more than one instances of the game can be launched on the same computer. Each instance can join the same game over Beamdog hosted-servers or Local Area Network.\nInfinite Proficiency Points.\nIt is possible to gain infinite proficiency points using a method similar to the Black Blade of Disaster Dual Class Trick. On a character capable of leveling up and allocating at least one point on Long Sword, give control of that character to Player 2, make Player 2 enter the Level Up screen and allocate a single point on Long Sword. On Player 1, using a character capable of Wild Surge and casting Black Blade of Disaster, have them apply Black Blade of Disaster with Wild Surge to the character controlled by Player 2. They should now be able to remove 5 points from Long Sword and re-allocate them as they choose.\nInfinite Thieving Points.\nIt is possible to gain infinite thieving points using a method similar above. Instead of Black Blade of Disaster, use spells that augment thieving skills such as Luck, Draw Upon Holy Might (increases Dexterity), etc.\nRegaining Character Control while in the Level Up Screen.\nTypically, a player cannot give actions nor access screens such as inventory, spells, etc. while in the Level Up screen. Also, that character appears to be immune to damage, effects and ignore dialogue until they finish the Level Up screen. It is possible to regain control and access to the inventory, spells, etc. by causing the HUD to popup on top the Level Up screen. While Player 2 is on the Level Up screen, have Player 1 rest. Player 2's HUD should now popup on top the Level Up screen (although this screen will still be active) and will be able to access other screen by clicking the inventory buttons on the left-side of the screen (hotkeys do not appear to work).\nExtended Spell Duration.\nEffects of spells such as Wild Surge #13 Polymorphed: Wolf and other beneficial spells can be extended indefinitely. However, the effect doesn't appear to persist on save and load. To extend the effect duration, give control of a character to Player 2 and apply beneficial spells to that character. Reform the party and remove that character from the party. Advance the time by sleeping. Both players should experience the sleep cutscene that prevents any actions. Return the removed character to the party. Beneficial effects on that character should now last indefinitely. (This bug can be unreliable and may need a few tries. It's unclear why the sleep cutscene causes some effects and not others to last indefinitely.)\nNazramu Gold Exploit.\nIf you have 20 reputation and 20 Charisma, you can repeatedly sell items to Nazramu and buy them back at a net profit because his buy and sell markups are so close together. Fully-charged Wands of Monster Summoning have the highest value and are therefore the fastest way to gain gold using this trick.\nThis is also possible with the Temple of Sekolah in BG2, unless an update closed the exploit.\nNishruu Infinite Charges.\nBe attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Nishruu\"&gt;Nishruu&lt;/a&gt; while possessing a weapon with a finite number of used charges, and the Nishruu warps the item to have near-infinite charges and allowing those weapons to be sold for millions of Gold. Especially useful with items like the Staff of Power, which are not once-per-day (which wipes the excess charges).\nObtain pickpocketable items with any class (except Wizard Slayers).\nNormally, one requires a Bard, a Thief or a Mage with a Cat or Ferret familiar to be able to pickpocket items, however, charmed thieves can be used to perform that function with other classes.\nFor example, to obtain Ribald's Ring of Regeneration with any class (except Wizard Slayers), you can turn Brennan Risling (the thief from Mencar Pebblecrusher's party at the Den of Seven Vales) hostile, let him follow you all the way into the Adventurer's Mart, charm him (for example, with the Ring of Human Influence) and then pickpocket Ribald. After Brennan has obtained the ring, you need only kill him (something you can do without penalty) to be able to loot the dropped ring.\nPacify hostile characters permanently.\nFirst of all, allegiances in the infinity engine games are very complex, but one can summarize them into two categories: hostile (to the player party) and non-hostile. Second, with few exceptions (like the charm effects from the Nymph Cloak and the Ring of Human Influence), every charm effect in the game switches allegiances once it runs out (or when it's dispelled), to make it so the previously charmed character turns against the charmer's faction.\nWe can use this knowledge to our advantage by forcing a hostile creature to use one of the \"switch allegiance charms\" (again, the most common kind of charm) on another hostile creature (or themselves), making it so said creature turns non-hostile once the charm effect wears out (or is dispelled) and can even be talked to, if they have dialogue attached to them. There are several ways to achieve this, but two of them are:\na) Use (Minor) Spell Turning to make it so a hostile character charms themselves (they have to fail the save) or force them to roll wild surges (with The Brick or the Tunic of Blindeye) to possibly get their targets switched, so they end up charming another hostile character (or themselves). Once the charm effect is gone, the charmed character should turn non-hostile.\nb) Charm a spellcaster (or any creature who can charm enemies) and wait for the charm effect to almost run out. Then, order your charmed spellcaster to cast a charm on an enemy, so that the charm on the spellcaster runs out during the spellcasting animation. If done correctly, the new charmed enemy will have been charmed by a \"hostile faction\" character, meaning that when the effect runs out, it'll turn non-hostile aka opposed to the \"hostile faction\".\nc) First, acquire a Thrall Collar from the Planar Prison. Then, cast a charm spell on an enemy and, while the casting animation is happening, equip the Thrall Collar, so that your party member turns hostile. Once again, when the charm wears off (or is dispelled), the enemy will switch allegiances to become non-hostile. Be sure to keep a Remove Curse spell ready to remove the Thrall Collar from your party member.\nParty-wide self-cast spells.\nIf you have:\na) A wild mage in your party;\nb) Access to a wild magic area (eg maze level of Watcher's Keep or Neera's Wild Forest); or\nc) An item that allows wild surges to happen (like The Brick).\nIt is possible to use Wild Surges #6, #48 and #90 to cast powerful and/or long-lasting self-cast spells like Stoneskin, Black Blade of Disaster and Time Stop on your party members. This is only useful for spells with long durations, major buffs and such, because, due to the nature of wild surging, you need to abuse quick saving/reloading to get one of those three wild surges to happen when you want (so you probably only want to do this before major battles).\nThe effects of area-wide Stoneskin and Black Blade of Disaster should be fairly easy to understand (your party gets the skins and your party gets BBDs), but Time Stop works a little bit differently. What happens if you get surge #6 or #90 is that each of your party members gets a Time Stop in a row. So, first, your caster gets Time Stop, then the party member closest to them, then the next one and so on. If you do this, you should have enemies just outside the fog of war so that you can rush in and hit them (don't be too close to the enemy when you cast, even if they're blue circle, otherwise they'll get a Time Stop as well!), plus, you might wanna give your caster the Staff of the Magi so they can dispel the enemy during Time Stop before your other party members get their own Time Stop rounds.\nPlaying a companion as the Child of Bhaal.\nWild Surge #65 can cause monsters to cast spells that are unintended. For example, Tanar'ri in the demon plane (Planar Sphere quest) can cause a Wild Surge #65 that turns the main character into a bat, vampiric mist or Kangaxx. (See Wild Surge: Oops, Wrong Spell for more details.) This permanently removes the main character but does not trigger the game to end as long as you have at least one other companion. This allows the game to continue without a main character.\nWithout a main character, certain scripts do not run. This may halt further progression; however, there's a workaround. A companion (such as Jaheira, Minsc, Edwin, etc) can fill the main character position by joining the party (leaving first if they are already in the party). The next companion that joins the party automatically takes the vacant position of the main character. Dialogue that use the main character name still use the original main character name.\nAlternatively, another way to fill the main character position is to reorder the character portraits so that the companion you want as the main character is at the top. Save, then load that game. That companion now becomes the main character. Unlike the first method, dialogue in this method correctly uses the companions name.\nIf Hexxat is the main character, when Hexxat takes lethal damage and becomes a vampiric mist, she remains invulnerable. The game will however end if she stands next to another companion which causes her to enter Dragomir's Repite.\nIf Wilson is the main character, their inability to have conversations makes progression difficult.\nIf a companion leaves, due to a quest or trigger, the main character position becomes vacant again, allowing another companion to take the position of the main character.\nPermanent clones and summons.\nAny clone/summon can be made to remain indefinitely in the world by being revived after dying. To achieve that, all you need to do is target them (so Mass Raise Dead doesn't work) with the Rod of Resurrection or a Resurrection spell (preferably the latter, as it has a long casting time) and kill the clone/summon before the resurrection effect takes place.\nThis will cause the clone/summon to be revived as a neutral character, which can then be charmed (preferably via the Nymph Cloak/Algernon's Cloak whose charm effects last 9 and 12 hours) to be of use to the party. The Nymph Cloak/Algernon's Cloak's charm effects are also preferable to most other kinds of charms as they won't turn the clone/summon hostile after it runs out.\nThe limitations of this exploit are that: a) not every character can be charmed (if you clone an elf, be sure to use a Cleric's Mental Domination that bypasses elven resistance to charm) and b) revived clones still won't drop cloned items, as they're all marked as undroppable/unstealable, so there's no item duplication possible.\nPermanent party-wide Polymorph Self/Shapechange.\nIf you have:\na) A wild mage in your party;\nb) Access to a wild magic area (eg maze level of Watcher's Keep or Neera's Wild Forest); or\nc) An item that allows wild surges to happen (like The Brick).\nIt is possible to use Wild Surges #6, #48 and #90 to alter the target of the spell so that a party member gets the Polymorph Self/Shapechange abilities instead of the caster; however, due to how the spell is coded, if your one or more of your party members is in another form when the duration of the spell expires they'll remain in said form \"permanently\", unable to change forms again or to return to their normal forms, unless:\na) They receive the benefits of a Polymorph Self/Shapechange spell again, so they get access to the \"Shapeshift: natural form\" ability;\nb) Use their own shapeshifting capabilities, if they're a druid;\nc) Use an item that allows one to shapeshift, like Relair's Mistake (wolf cloak) in BG1 and the Cloak of the Sewers in BG2.\nPet Basilisk Strategy/Basilisk XP Loop.\nYou can charm a basilisk using Algernon's Cloak from BG1. If you cast Protection from Petrification on the basilisk after charming it, you can use the pet basilisk to clear out Mutamin's Garden much faster than missile weapons, especially in Legacy of Bhaal mode.\nYou can also gain even more XP than would normally be possible in Mutamin's Garden using Stone to Flesh scrolls. After clearing out most of the area, charm a Lesser Basilisk (approach from behind and flee if it doesn't work), cast Protection from Petrification on it, and then have it petrify a Greater Basilisk. Then, before the Lesser Basilisk can attack again and shatter the Greater Basilisk, order it to stop and use a Stone to Flesh scroll on the petrified basilisk. You can then re-petrify it for another 7000 XP for every Stone to Flesh scroll you have. You can buy 19 scrolls from the temples at the Friendly Arm Inn and near Beregost for a total of 38 even before you reach Baldur's Gate (where even more scrolls are for sale). It's by far the fastest way of gaining XP in BG1, and requires little money and virtually no risk.\nPickpocket Equipped Weapons.\nEnemy/npc weapons aren't generally flagged as unstealable in the game simply due to the fact that a thief already can't steal them while the NPC has the weapon equipped (not merely placed in the weapon slots, actually equipped). With that said, if you manage to change an enemy/npc's equipped weapon (say, via the use of polymorph other or a wand of polymorph, which changes their equipped weapon to the squirrel's natural attack), your thief will be able to pickpocket the item (if you use the polymorph method you can either feeblemind them beforehand so they won't aggro or you can charm them afterwards so you can pickpocket them again).\nAlternatively, if the enemy/npc has a) a regular class (mage, fighter etc.) and b) any droppable weapon in its weapon slots (eg not a dragon's claw attack), then you can simply charm them to change their equipped weapon. If those conditions aren't met, then the quick weapon selection bar won't show up when you charm them, even if they have multiple undroppable weapons (eg summoned winter wolves have a paw attack and their wintery breath, but you can't select between them).\nPotion of Power Trick.\nIf you drink multiple potions of power, the HP bonus, if not the THAC0 bonus, will stack indefinitely, warriors can get hundreds of HP this way, allowing them to survive the 1500 damage from &lt;a href=\"Slayer%20Form\"&gt;Slayer Form&lt;/a&gt; via auto-save timer reset. The bonuses can be dispelled though, and Potions of Power are rare. This should be cumulative with the Wand of Lightning trick.\nPotions are fast.\nIn BG2 drinking action is speed 0 or 1, almost instantaneously. If drinking Potion of Explosions or Oil of fiery burning, that's a bunch of fireballs center on drinker. Couple that with protection from fire for self protection.\nOr instead of that stack of potion you can replace with a wand of fire instead. It can be recharged easier than you can find those potions.\nIf you use potion of (extra) healing, you can drink a bunch of potions at once and get healed. A good way to deal with those numerous potions.\nIf you use to turn pages in the Book of Daily Spell, you'll get 6 copies of the next page, allowing you to duplicate the book (unless you hit the Burning Hands page on the first try).\nIt's also possible to use the Wand of Lightning trick to target things from all the way across the map by dedicating one of the six targets to a container or item on the ground.\nQuick Save Trick.\nLoading the game resets the aura and stealth timer of all party members. By quick-saving and then quick-loading, you can cast multiple spells or drink multiple potions within the same round, provided that you are not in combat. This can extend the lifespan of short-duration effects, or allow an Archer to stack Called Shot effects right before combat begins.\nRandom Treasure Re-roll.\n&lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt; is generated upon entering an area. By saving and reloading in an area leading to another area with random treasure, you can re-roll the treasure until you find a particular item, potion, scroll, etc. This is useful if you're looking for a specific spell. Note that not all scrolls can be found this way (see &lt;a href=\"Random%20treasure\"&gt;Random treasure&lt;/a&gt;).\nAn example of this trick is: save the game before activating the portal in Irenicus' Lair, travel through the portal then check bookshelf in the mephit portal room. This bookshelf contains \"Rich\" treasure, which has a chance of rolling a random level 3 scroll (e.g., Spell Trap, Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Spell Sequencer, etc.)\nReforming Party/Removing Members Exploits (Multiple).\nInnate Abilities.\nBy removing and adding a party member, it will refresh their innate abilities (but not spells). This includes innate abilities such as:\nThis exploit is particularly broken on &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Legacy of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt; difficulty with &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Spirit%20Animal\"&gt;Summon Spirit Animal&lt;/a&gt; ability for Totemic Druids. \nIn the original BG2, a character with the Dual Class option can replenish their class special abilities by entering the Dual Class window and closing it. \nFatigue.\nRemoving and adding a party member resets their &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; level.\nKarma.\nIf a party member other than the main character kills an innocent, removing them immediately after the killing blow is dealt will avoid incurring the &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; penalty.\nTargeting by enemies/spells.\nYou can temporarily kick characters out of the party to get enemies to ignore them at critical times. Certain spells like Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting, Slow, Greater Malison, and Dragon's Breath will have no effect on neutral critters, so if you kick out a party member before such a spell is about to hit, the spell will fail completely. Enemies will also avoid attacking neutral critters, which means you can get party members out of dangerous situations merely by booting them from the party. The enemy will ignore them until they rejoin the party. If you turn the main character invisible and remove everyone else from the party, you can walk the whole group right past any number of enemies in complete safety while only using a single invisibility spell or potion or Protection from Undead scroll.\nSingle-target and non-party-friendly spells will still hit, however, as will arrows in midair. This means that the Reform Party trick can't rescue party members from all dangers. A character who dies while outside the party cannot be resurrected, so it's not wise to use this trick when a character is close to death.\nUnlike other escape options, the Reform Party trick can be done at any time, regardless of aura, even when the whole party is disabled, or even during an enemy mage's Time Stop spell.\nRemove Curse Trick.\nRemove Curse can be cast on enemies with cursed items, who will immediately drop the item. This can be used to weaken characters such as Kontik, Brage, and Smaeluv Orcslicer.\nRevive monsters or Yoshimo after his \"permanent\" death.\nPretty simple trick: you can target \"untargetable\" characters (such as anybody who dies and is not a member of the player's party) to revive them by using the Rod of Resurrection (or any other resurrection method, I assume) on the character right before they actually die. What happens is that they will still be targeted after death and will revive, so you can do this when Yoshimo has a \"heart attack\" when you find him at the Copper Coronet in Chapter 6 (I've only tested this with a Yoshimo that had never been in my party before, it probably doesn't work if you take him with you to Spellhold).\nYou can also revive monsters by targeting them while alive and killing them before the revive spell is cast. Using this exploit, you can farm &lt;a href=\"Firkraag\"&gt;Firkraag&lt;/a&gt; for XP.\nSaving Imoen from Irenicus' Lair.\nAn old speed run bug allowed the player to skip Irenicus' dialogue when escaping his lair to Waukeen's Promenade. This same bug occasionally also allowed Imoen to remain in the party.\nThe bug requires that Imeon be removed from the party next to the Dwarven forge as the rest of the party leave to the surface. (See &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/zydppd/speedrunners_dont_want_you_to_know_this_one/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for a video demonstration.)\nIf Imoen reaches 1HP she will leave the party similar to her scripted behavior in Irenicus' Lair.\nImoen will be wearing her belt which grants her immunity to many effects, including polymorph. This means when she changes forms she remains as human but takes on the weapons from the form change, e.g. she remains a human but has the attack of an Iron Golem when she uses Shapechange: Iron Golem. (See Immune to Polymorph Grants Polymorph Weapon while Staying as Human Form.)\nRescueing Imoen later in the main storyline allows the party to have 2 Imoens in the party.\nSelf-centered Spells Trick.\nSpells cast on self-ignore magic resistance. Thus, a &lt;a href=\"False%20Dawn\"&gt;False Dawn&lt;/a&gt; spell, which is cast on self by default, will bypass magic resistance on nearby targets, allowing you to deal fire damage to skeletons warriors and other magic-immune critters.\nNo longer works for &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; in EE.\nShadowdancer Trick.\nYou can maintain invisibility indefinitely as a Shadowdancer by manipulating the stealth timer. Click Hide, then click Detect Traps (or any other button) immediately. This will not break invisibility until after 2 rounds. After 6 seconds (3 seconds if hasted), you will be able to hide again. Use this to go invisible, wait until the Hide icon is enabled, backstab, and then go invisible again without ever exposing yourself to attack.\nShadow Twin Army.\nA Shadow Twin is able to create another single Shadow Twin provided it still has at least one use of the ability.\nNormally, a Shadow Twin incurs a 60% level penalty, but when a Simulacrum or Project Image uses Shadow Twin the resulting clone does not incur this penalty. To further, all generations of Shadow Twins created by Shadow Twins do not incur this penalty!\nDue to second and later generation Shadow Twins not inheriting the items of their caster, to take advantage of a Shadow Twin army, the character needs to dual class to Mage or Cleric to access spells.\nA Shadow Twin dual mage can cast Project Image followed by a number of Shadow Twin equal to their uses of the ability per day. Each of these Shadow Twins have the same spells as the Project Image, including any level 9 or HLA spells such as Improved Alacrity and Time Stop, granting a vast arsenal of high-level spells as well as multiple casters.\nShamanic Spirits Remain and Follow a Moving Shaman (requires 2 Shamans).\nThere are two conditions for spirits from &lt;a href=\"Shamanic%20Dance\"&gt;Shamanic Dance&lt;/a&gt; to not disappear: a) a Shaman must be dancing and b) a Shaman must be within sight of the spirits. However, those two conditions need not be met by the same Shaman, producing an exploit that lets one of the Shamans roam around a map with spirits following them, while another Shaman dances (alone) somewhere else, just to keep them from disappearing.\nSo, these are the steps necessary to produce this exploit:\n-Move one of the Shamans away (let's call them \"Isolated Shaman\"), so the spirits that will be summoned by the other Shaman (let's call them \"Moving Shaman\") can't see them. You can leave them inside a closed room or a bit far away, for example.\n-Have the Moving Shaman start dancing, so they get the maximum number of spirits (if you want, you can kill weaker spirits with other party members, so they're replaced by better ones).\n-Start dancing with the Isolated Shaman (no spirits will come out, as you're already at the party limit).\n-Done. The Moving Shaman is now able to move around, and the spirits will follow them! But keep in mind that: a) If the spirits lose sight of the Moving Shaman (or any other Shaman, if you have more) they'll disappear, so watch out for corners and b) If no enemies are around and the spirits spot the dancing Isolated Shaman, they'll flock to them (if no enemies are around, spirits seem to be programmed to move towards the closest dancing Shaman).\nOf course, the biggest limitation of this exploit is that your Moving Shaman won't be dancing to produce more spirits if the enemies kill them; however, the Isolated Shaman will be doing that. This means that you can quickly switch their roles by having the previous Moving Shaman start dancing, so that the previous Isolated Shaman can now move around with the spirits they summoned.\nSlayer Change Trick for EE.\nGorion's Ward may remain in Slayer form indefinitely (well, close to it, as area transitions and cutscenes revert you to your natural form) by surviving the 7 rounds of self-damage you experience after remaining in the form for a while. To put it simply: the damage is of the \"magic damage\" kind, so a mere &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic%20Energy\"&gt;Protection from Magic Energy&lt;/a&gt; cast (which need only remain in effect until the waves of self-damage are over) is enough to survive it and any solo non-Wizard Slayer character can access that in Throne of Bhaal via the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20the%20Dark%20Moon\"&gt;Cloak of the Dark Moon&lt;/a&gt;, but there are several other ways to achieve 100% magic damage resistance (a combination of items that increase it with Armor of Faith, for example).\nAnother easy way to do this is with a Shaman, as their &lt;a href=\"Favored%20of%20the%20Spirits\"&gt;Favored of the Spirits&lt;/a&gt; high-level ability allows them to survive the otherwise fatal self-damage.\nFinally, a more convoluted way to achieve this is by combining several item-related exploits. The Potion of Power trick with the Quick-Save trick and the Item Duplication trick (and perhaps also the Wand of Lightning trick to speed things up), you can boost your HP above 1500 in the ~7 rounds in between the beginning of Slayer Change and the 1500 magic damage that instantly kills you at the end. You have to have 20 or more Potions of Power (or even more, if you're not using the Wand of Lightning trick), probably via item duplication, and you need to be near an area transition.\nBegin Slayer Change, enter the new area to force the game to auto-save, then load the auto-save. Drink a Potion of Power, force another auto-save by entering the next area, and load up the auto-save again to allow an action to be taken without delay, allowing you to drink another Potion of Power. If you drink enough potions before the end of Slayer Change, you'll survive the 1500 damage. You will therefore be able to sustain the Slayer form indefinitely.\nSpell Trap Trick.\nWhile not strictly an exploit, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; can be used to restore an infinite number of spells by using level 9 effects against the caster. A Project Image clone can cast level 7 and level 9 spells to restore the original caster's spells. For a Simulacrum clone to be able to do the same thing, it would have to be level 18, which means only a level 35 mage (impossible without removing the XP cap) could do the same using Simulacrum instead of Project Image. To do this trick, have the clone strike a caster protected by Spell Trap using &lt;a href=\"Black%20Blade%20of%20Disaster\"&gt;Black Blade of Disaster&lt;/a&gt;, each hit absorbed restores one level 9 spell. The same works with &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteor&lt;/a&gt; for level 3 spells.\nSpell Trigger Trick.\nYou can prevent offensive Spell Triggers from breaking invisibility simply by choosing the caster as the target. Since the game considers spell triggers to be single-target spells, they don't break invisibility when cast on self. This allows you to launch three Death Fog spells, say, without ever becoming visible.\nStealth with Advantage.\nIn BG2EE, the Advanced AI and Thief AIs count stealth cooldown using a script timer, not the stealth icon state. This exploit allows the character to immediately re-roll stealth if you fail to manually enter stealth. To do this, your thief must enable the Advanced AI or Thief AI which prioritize being in stealth. While the stealth icon is disabled, give the thief an action such as a walk command to prevent the AI from entering stealth immediately once stealth is ready. Manually enter stealth. If this manual attempt fails, the AI will immediate stealth again, hence granting advantage (the best outcome of two rolls) on stealth.\nIn combination with &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt;, which halves stealth timers, and the Shadowdancer Trick, a character can remain in stealth more often and more consistently.\nSummoned Demon Behavior.\nSummoned demons ignore the summoning limit. Normally, summoning multiple demons will cause them to turn against each other, but casting Protection from Evil 10' Radius will get them to ignore each other and concentrate on your enemies instead (though they won't grant XP if killed).\nTalk-blocking.\nClicking on a neutral character will cause the character to turn to you and wait for you to speak with it. It will not take any other action for several seconds even if you order your character to do something else, so you can click on neutral characters to prevent them from talking to you, or even prevent them from defending themselves when you attack them.\nTeleport through Walls/Locked Doors using Wild Magic.\nUsing a wild mage (or any items/areas that can prompt wild surges, though it's easier to do with a Wild Mage because they can incite surges via Nahal's Reckless Dweomer), it is possible to cast a version of the level 4 spell Teleport Field that affects your own party (for example, Wild Surge #21 works for this purpose).\nIf cast near a wall/door, it is possible for the spell to teleport you through said wall/door, because even though the spell only applies to creatures located inside the \"squiggly lines\" visual effect, it can actually then send you much further away than that area.\nThis might not work if the wall you're trying to bypass is too thick, though. Teleport Field can only send you a little bit further away from the \"squiggly area\".\nTears of Bhaal tests.\nTest of Fear.\nExploit #1: In the original it possible to take the Good path AND the Cloak. Ask the devil for time to think then get the Tear, use it on the five-eyed door, then come back and ask the Cloak from the devil.\nExploit #2: In BG2EE it is possible to get evil rewards without becoming fallen paladin/ranger. Bring only 1 party member to the room of test of fear (you can leave the rest outside near the eye gate and pick them up later). Ask the devil to wait for your decision. Have boots of cheetah on both you and your other party member. Make sure both have improved haste and speed oils up. Place one party member very close to the devil and the other one very close to the place where you get the tear (be careful not to get feared). Carefully take the tear with one character and immediately talk to the devil with the other character saying that you want the cloak. Once you have the cloak and the tear, both characters should exit the zone before devil disappears. The reason this exploit works is that your character does not immediately fall from grace when you accept the cloak. Instead, you have a small window of a few seconds to exit the area before your class changes. Once you are outside of the room you have both tear and cloak and you get to keep your class. Make sure not to go back to the room or it will change your class. Note: once you turn the tear in to the gate your alignment will change to evil, but your class will stay the same and you won't become a fallen version of your class. This allows for lawful evil paladins and rangers. \nTest of Selfishness.\nExploit #1: Haste a party member (might also need Spell Trigger: Dispel), and let them open the doors from the inside. This at least prevents the loss of DEX (but not the -2 hp), or the death of the character as punishment. (EE fixes this exploit)\u00a0\nExploit #2: before opening the good doors cast Spell Immunity: Divination. You won't lose anything. (EE fixes this little gap)\u00a0\nExploit #3: right when the conversation ends with the fiend pause and talk to it again before it teleports to the other side. Now you don't have to open the doors. If you want to go in for the healing potions, use the evil doors, as there won't be anyone to die. You get the good reward for this.\nExploit #4: &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; can kick all party members from the group. The devil will now summon an innocent peasant for the Bhaalspawn to sacrifice. After receiving the tear, companions can be invited back in the group.\nExploit #5 (works in EE): In order to get the good outcome without any penalties, try using a Maze spell on your main character and then quickly opening all three doors on the left with any other character. If you are fast enough, it is then possible to pickpocket the tear from the demon before he teleports away (try initiating dialogue with him as you open the third door, which will keep him frozen in place while you run over and steal it).\nExploit #6 (works in v2.6 EE): To successfully finish the good path without any penalties you will need 2 Maze spells and a Freedom spell (needed for convenience, to end the Maze spell shortly). First, cast Maze on the party member that will be kidnapped. Second, initiate the dialogue with the demon and let it teleport with the victim. Third, cast Freedom spell - this will let your kidnapped party member reappear early without being \"held\". Fourth, cast Maze spell on the main character. Fifth, open all doors on the left from the inside with the kidnapped character and rejoin the party. Rest to end the Maze spell on the main character and talk with the demon to get the Tear of Bhaal.\nExploit #7: The last door on the good path reduces XP by 75,000. A character with less than that amount underflows, leading them to reach level 41 regardless of class. See the section on Level 41 Characters for more details.\nTest of Greed.\nExploit #1: In vanilla BG2 it is possible to pickpocket the good Tear from the genie thereby getting both the good reward and Blackrazor. This is not possible in BG2:EE. It is however possible to give Genie the sword (Good path) then kill him before he teleports away and get the sword this way.\nTeleportation Movement Speed.\nWild Surges #20 and #81 reduce movement speed by 4. A character affected by one or more such surge with less than 4 movement speed will move instantaneously as if they were teleporting. (The character's destination must still be accessible, i.e. this does not make closed doors passable.)\nThere are multiple ways to lower a character's movement speed such as Entangle, Grease, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (see Invincible Barbarians and Undead Hunters) and Wild Surges #11 and #69. Causing a character to be over encumbered does not appear to work.\nAccording to the game data, &lt;a href=\"T%27rachie%27s%20Plate\"&gt;T'Rachie's Plate&lt;/a&gt; has an unlisted 1 movement speed penalty, which could be a substitute for Wild Surge #20 or #81, however the engine does not seem to treat the effect from T'Rachie's Plate the same as the Wild Surges.\nThe Perfect Murder.\nBy using the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Human%20Influence\"&gt;Ring of Human Influence&lt;/a&gt;, it's possible to use a charmed npc to kill another without turning anyone hostile (except in the rare instances where they're programmed to turn hostile whenever someone dies no matter what reason, you can check by using the CTRL+Y instant kill cheat - if people turn hostile, then they're programmed like that).\nThe Ring of Human Influence has one of the few non-hostile charm effects in the game - meaning that when it runs out, the npc will remain friendly - and, unlike the Nymph Cloak its duration isn't hours long, which is important for the trick.\nTo do it, simply charm someone with the ring, wait 99 seconds (the effect lasts 100 seconds) and then order the npc to attack another far away from them. If you do it correctly, the charm will run out before the npc reaches their target, but they'll still carry out the attack order. The target shouldn't turn hostile either and might even just take the damage - depending on their script - until they die.\nUsing potions without interrupting the effects of Shamanic Dance.\nShamans are notoriously vulnerable while dancing (they can't ordinarilly move without ending the dance and suffer a +4 penalty to AC) and the games also make it hard for the Shaman to do some things immediately after ending the dance, due to the fact spellcasting and quick item buttons are disabled for a while.\nWith that said, the player is still able to order their character to use potions via the inventory screen and the Shamanic Dance's effects will continue (ie the spirits won't disappear) as long as the player is dancing at the end of a round/start of the next round (and isn't moving). All of this makes it possible for a player to keep the Shamanic Dance effects going and still be able to drink potions by following these steps:\n-First, make sure you're not near the end of the round, just to be safe. There are many ways to be able to tell this, but since you're a Shaman and you're dancing, just pay attention to the log: if the \"Dancing Shamanic Dance\" message has just appeared (automatically, cause it also appears right after you click the dance button), that means a new round has just started.\n-Pause the game, enter the inventory screen, right-click the potion and choose 'drink potion'.\n-Quickly unpause and pause again, to allow your character to actually drink the potion. As long as you're not suffering from a &lt;a href=\"slow%20effect\"&gt;slow effect&lt;/a&gt;, it should happen immediately right after you unpause, so there's no need to wait for it.\n-Re-enable the Shamanic Dance, by clicking the button.\n=Done, you can unpause at will now. \nTechnically-speaking, you can use this exploit to perform other actions with a Shaman and still keep up the Shamanic Dance's effects, but anything other than drinking a potion tends to take more time (especially some actions where your character might not act immediately), so it's harder to do anything else consistently.\nWaiting.\nMost enemies have spells encoded on items that have limited timers, so by not pausing the game in places like the Temple of Bhaal or the Northern Island, bosses becoming much weaker in time due to their protection spells running out.\nWand of Lightning Trick.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; in BG2 and BG2EE (but not BG1 or SoD) fires up to 6 lightning bolts, each with their own target. This trick duplicates up to 6 times the effects of an item, ability or a memorized self-target spell, such as &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordenkainen%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Mordenkainen's Sword&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo perform this trick for memorized self-target spells and abilities, select 6 targets with the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, then immediately order the character to cast the spell or ability. Instead of firing 6 lightning bolts, the character will cast the spell or ability 6 times, using only a single memorization of that spell or ability. \nIn no particular order, here is an incomplete list of spells and abilities that gain 6 times their effect (some require multi-classing or dual-classing):\nThis trick can also be used with certain quickslot items: choose 6 targets with the Wand of Lightning, navigate to the inventory screen and swap the Wand of Lightning for another item.\nIn no particular order, here is an incomplete list of items that gain 6 times their effect (some require multi-classing or dual-classing):\nWand of Wonder XP Loop.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Wonder\"&gt;Wand of Wonder&lt;/a&gt; petrifies a target with no saves. It can be used on dragons or &lt;a href=\"Kangaxx\"&gt;Kangaxx&lt;/a&gt; to immediately petrify them, granting a large amount of XP. Use &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; to unpetrify the target. Placing the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Wonder\"&gt;Wand of Wonder&lt;/a&gt; and a scroll of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; on a clone allows this trick to be repeated without consuming charges or scrolls.\nTo be clear, when the Wand of Wonder fires a charge, a D100 is rolled to determine what effect will be launched. In order to get the petrification effect, the random number generator must roll between 37-48, or it will be a different effect.\nNote: In BG2EE the &lt;a href=\"RING95.ITM\"&gt;RING95.ITM&lt;/a&gt; worn by many creatures including undead, all liches and others prevents the &lt;a href=\"Petrified\"&gt;Petrified&lt;/a&gt; status effect. So, the Wand of Wonder petrification will do nothing. Also, Kangaax also is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"MINHP1.ITM\"&gt;MINHP1.ITM&lt;/a&gt;, which also prevents petrification. And thus, the exploit will not work on some creatures, even with no saving throw.\nWild Surge: Oops, Wrong Spell.\nWild Surge: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Surge%3Fso%3Dsearch%2365\"&gt;#65&lt;/a&gt; (Oops, Wrong Spell) casts another spell rather than the desired one, sometimes casting a spell that was never meant to be accessible. (See the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Surge%3Fso%3Dsearch%23Technical_details_on_Oops%2C_wrong_spell\"&gt;Wild Surges page&lt;/a&gt; for more details.)\nNon-Wild Mages can apply Wild Surges to other party members and enemy creatures through the effects of Wild Magic, e.g. wielding &lt;a href=\"The%20Brick\"&gt;The Brick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Sling\"&gt;Wild Sling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tunic%20of%20Blindeye\"&gt;Tunic of Blindeye&lt;/a&gt; or standing in the Wild Forest.\nWild Surge #65 on innate Bhaal spawn abilities, e.g. Larloch's Minor Drain, Draw Upon Holy Might, etc., can cast druid spells including permanently turning the caster into a wolf or brown bear. \nSome innate or class abilities, e.g. Detect Evil, Protection from Evil, Shadowstep, Exaltation, Divine Favor, Chaos of Battle, Create Magic Flute, etc, under Wild Surge #65 can apply Blackguard class passive abilities such as Negative Plane Protection and Resist Fear which are permanent in duration, allowing other classes to permanently gain passive bonuses of Blackguards.\nWild Surge #65 when applied to enemies also yields strange and powerful effects. Some creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Tanar%27ri\"&gt;Tanar'ris&lt;/a&gt; and Nabassu (from the level 7 &lt;a href=\"Cacofiend\"&gt;Cacofiend&lt;/a&gt; spell), dragons and beholders, cast spells/abilities through scripts that are not accessible to player characters which can cause a Wild Surge #65. For example, Tanar'ri and Nabassu that cast Death Gaze (SPIN996.SPL) can:\nA Wild Surge #65 from dragons and beholders can:\nClassic exploits.\nExploits that work only on earlier EE versions and classic games, with a few exceptions.\nAlgernon's Cloak.\n&lt;a href=\"Algernon\"&gt;Algernon&lt;/a&gt; is a portly old man on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Feldepost%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Feldepost's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beregost\"&gt;Beregost&lt;/a&gt;. He wears what appears to be a &lt;a href=\"Nymph%20Cloak\"&gt;Nymph's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; but it has nearly unlimited charges of Charm, which requires a very high Save vs. Breath Weapon to resist. The quest involving &lt;a href=\"Algernon%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Algernon's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; does not trigger until the player arrives in Baldur's Gate, but the cloak itself is available as early as Chapter 1. Most parties would not know Algernon has the cloak, as typically only an evil-aligned party would murder Algernon and discover it, and thieves would not know some random man in an inn would possess such a powerful item.\nThe cloak can be used to charm almost any character in the game, allowing them to reveal information while under the charmed effect (Baldur's Gate II removes these dialogue strings, preventing players from conversing with charmed/dominated characters) and also allowing one to command them in battle. This even applies to characters far beyond the player's level and abilities, allowing some battles to be won fairly easily so long as the target fails the saving throw. Tactical use of &lt;a href=\"Algernon%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Algernon's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; can allow players to command such as &lt;a href=\"Taurgosz%20Khosann\"&gt;Taurgosz \"Tenhammer\" Khosann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ardenor%20Crush\"&gt;Ardenor Crush&lt;/a&gt; to destroy their own &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Camp\"&gt;Bandit Camp&lt;/a&gt; (as they are the strongest characters in camp) or to take over a &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Wolf\"&gt;Vampiric Wolf&lt;/a&gt; (immune to normal weapons) to massacre the wolf pack it is a part of.\nAn especially useful exploitation of the unlimited-charm aspect of the cloak is in preventing arrest in situations where thieving could be noticed. This essentially replaces the need for one or more mage members forced to expend Level 1 slots to do the same thing.\nAnother useful exploitation of the cloak is the ability to kill civilians for their money or objects without loss of reputation, if you have paired members. Separate the paired members by leaving one in a building or a room and dismiss the other member from the team. Charm the civilian, attack the dismissed member, and flee. The dismissed member will perceive the civilian as an enemy and attack him/her. After the civilian is killed, use the separated member to invite the dismissed member back onto the team.\nChaos Shield Trick.\nChaos Shields can stack if they are combined in a Spell Sequencer/Trigger or (Chain) Contingency.\nThis is no longer possible in EE.\nDagger of Venom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Venom\"&gt;dagger of venom&lt;/a&gt; is a unique item in the Baldur's Gate trilogy. While the \"venom\" is depicted as a form of poison, it isn't affected by poison modifiers and is actually a special form of damage that no NPCs have resistance against. This means that any monster or NPC is stabbed by the dagger and fails the save will incur damage. In the original Baldur's Gate, even monsters that were not intended to be killed (such as the Demon Knight, Ulcaster's Ghost, Duke Eltan, Return to Candlekeep Ulraunt &amp; Tethtoril) can be slain by the dagger. The dagger's ability to induce \"poison\" also gives it the ability to break scripts, as NPCs who are stabbed by it miss their timing for delivering scripts.\nThe best weapon to go along with the dagger are ordinary fists, as fist damage can penetrate Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. Monsters or NPCs captured by the sphere have invulnerability but low evasion, allowing a barehanded opponent to easily reduce their HP to zero and knock them out. Once unconscious, their ability to successfully save against the dagger of venom is diminished, and the dagger only needs to do 1 HP worth of damage to kill the enemy.\nDeath Ray Agannazar's Scorcher.\nYou can multiply the effects of the scorcher loop even further by combining it with the &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Wand of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; Trick. Have two characters cast &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously using the Wand of Lightning trick and either the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; page of the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Infinite%20Spells\"&gt;Book of Infinite Spells&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; scroll. Have a third character cast &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; across both of them. The loop will strike 10,000 times over several rounds, enough to kill any enemy that is not immune to fire or level 2 spells. Testing killed &lt;a href=\"Adalon\"&gt;Adalon&lt;/a&gt; in Legacy of Bhaal mode in just over a second.\nThis can also be done by using the Reflect Magic HLA from the Wizard Slayer Rebalancing mod.\nExceeding the summon limit.\nThe summon limit of 5 summoned critters per map does not apply to clones. Project Image and Simulacrum clones can summon an unlimited number of critters in any area. This also allows you to summon multiple Devas or Planetars, bypassing the celestial summon limit of 1.\nExporting.\nDimension Door.\nDimension Door is a cool if impractical spell in Baldur's Gate, as the player's version is limited to line-of-sight (the NPC version is like a long-distance teleport). The spell was removed from Baldur's Gate II because it broke scripts in play testing, but it can be retained via the No Portrait Exploit where the player can teleport to line-of-site areas that are inaccessible by walking (such as the goblin pillars in Spellhold). The spell's value truly shines in the final battle at the Mana Forge, where a wizard is capable of teleporting onto any of the platforms around the forge and avoid the hordes of melee-only baatezu Melissan is constantly gating in.\nThe spell can still break scripts, possibly Yoshimo's (allowing him to remain with the party into Throne of Bhaal).\nDouble Ring of Wizardry.\nSome items like the &lt;a href=\"Evermemory\"&gt;Rings of Wizardry&lt;/a&gt; are disallowed on both fingers in Baldur's Gate II, but if one is wearing double rings going in, they're still able to gain the effects of both in BG2, they just cannot swap between items and must wear the double rings at all times.\nBecause the Ring of Wizardry worked differently in Baldur's Gate, granting double the Level 1 spells instead of a Level 5,6,7 spell, if the player has memorized the maximum number of spells allowed by two rings in BG1 (20) they'll retain that memory in BG2 and go overslot with the spells. As with modifying the Rings of Wizardy themselves, this means the Level 1 spells can no longer be adjusted, but it also means the player effectively has 20 Magic Missile, Chromatic Orb, etc. instead of just 5.\nBeing able to spam Magic Missile in Throne of Bhaal becomes extremely powerful, when combined with items that reduce casting time, alacrity and time stop, it can be cast instantaneously, disrupting all moves an opponent will attempt (even walking) while inflicting upwards of 200 damage if there is no immunity or Magic Resistance.\nIrenicus Dungeon Pause.\nWhen a new game is started in Shadows of Amn, a cutscene begins with Irenicus where the player character has no items. Items imported from Baldur's Gate are removed by a script at the start of this cutscene. However, there is a brief period where the player has control right before cutscene mode goes into effect. The screen is dark and because the character starts out in a cage, he/she cannot move. A quick player can pause the game during this period of freedom, and dump all items on his/her person. This avoids having the items wiped by the script and allows them to be requipped after freedom is restored. However, the Double Rings of Wizardry won't work if this method is applied.\nNo Portrait Import.\nWhen importing a character from Baldur's Gate or Tales of the Sword Coast, Baldur's Gate II has the player reassign their stats on their character sheet, then wipes their inventory before dropping the character in the Irenicus Dungeon. However, if the player is using a custom portrait but doesn't carry that portrait over from the BG1 directory to BG2, all of this reassignment is skipped and the player is automatically forwarded through the character creation right to assigning appearance and name.\nHelmet of Opposite Alignment.\nThis powerful &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20of%20Opposite%20Alignment\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; was included in the original BG item list but could not be found in game until Tales of the Sword Coast, where the Demon Knight that spawns on the ground floor of Durlag's Tower is wearing it. The Demon Knight in this appearance does not have much in the way of Magic Resistance, but has high HP, suggesting BioWare intended the player to attack it but do little damage. To obtain the helmet, the Demon Knight must be killed quickly before he de-spawns. The most consistent way to do this is cast &lt;a href=\"Otiluke%27s%20Resilient%20Sphere\"&gt;Otiluke's Resilient Sphere&lt;/a&gt; on the Demon Knight, immobilizing him, then using fists aided by Haste to reduce his HP and knock him out. Once knocked out, he can be slain with regular weapons once the sphere dissipates, or be killed through the sphere with the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Venom\"&gt;Dagger of Venom&lt;/a&gt;.\nA second exploit available through use of the helmet is to permanently alter a character's alignment. When a character is wearing the helmet, apply the &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Masculinity/Femininity\"&gt;Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity&lt;/a&gt;, which will invert the character's sex while also reverting their alignment back to what it was before donning the helmet. Once the curses are removed, the player will be permanently of the opposite alignment, and will behave just as an evil character would.\nThis alignment exploit applies in both Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II, and also alters the behavior of characters with the new alignment. For example, paladins with Lawful Evil alignment will not fall if a party's reputation plummets, and rather will complain, leave or fight the player if the party's reputation climbs too high. Use of this odd interaction with cursed items can allow players to (somewhat) legally expand the number of good, evil characters they want to party with in both games.\nHotkey trick.\n&lt;a href=\"Nahal%27s%20Reckless%20Dweomer\"&gt;Nahal's Reckless Dweomer&lt;/a&gt; can be cast by any mage, sorcerer, or bard by mapping it to a hotkey. The hotkey will never deplete spell slots; NRD can be cast an infinite number of times, ignoring aura, as if the caster was under the effects of Improved Alacrity. &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Surge\"&gt;Wild Surge&lt;/a&gt;s are still possible, so the Wild Mage is still best at this due to the existence of the Chaos Shield spells.\nThis also works for &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Contingency\"&gt;Chain Contingency&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be cast by any druid or cleric as well.\nThis is no longer possible in EE.\nIcewind Dale Haste Trick.\nIn the original Icewind Dale, before the Enhanced Edition, haste effects actually reduced the character's round time from 6 seconds to 3 seconds. This means that hasted characters in the original game not only attack twice as many times every 6 seconds; they also activate bard songs twice as often (granting double the bonuses each round, or allowing you to sing two different songs within the same round) and even cast two spells in the same round.\nOutside of Icewind Dale, in the BG saga, haste still speeds up speed timers, allowing blind thieves and Shadowdancers to backstab twice per round. But this can also prevent backstabbing by speeding up the time it takes for a thief to become visible again.\nItem Duplication.\nYou can duplicate items using a shop or a bag of holding. First, you need at least two (or possibly three) copies of the item you want to duplicate. Sell one copy to a shop, exit out of the shop, and then go back to the shop's menu. Purchase the item back, but instead of clicking \"Done,\" click the inventory button on the left side of the screen, twice. You will then return to the game screen, at which point you can re-enter the shop. \nIf you do this repeatedly, you can create an unlimited number of copies of the item, as skipping the \"Done\" button prevents the shop from deleting its own supply. Thus, you can always buy another copy. Using a bag of holding works the same way, but costs nothing.\nFurther testing has found that, if you are performing the trick via a Bag of Holding at least, you do not actually need two copies of the item in question. A single copy is sufficient.\nThis trick was introduced in one of the v2.x patches, but removed in v2.5\nLevel Up Twice.\nAs a side effect of skipping the character creation stat reassignment, the player character is reduced to Level 1 but retains all their Experience, allowing them to repeat the level up process up through Level 7 or 9. This can double a player's HP, although ultimately it has no effect on total weapon proficiencies or spell level acquisition.\nPotion Swap Glitch.\nYou can use any item by right-clicking a potion in the inventory, clicking \"Drink Potion,\" and then quickly switching the potion out for another item. This would allow a mage to use a Potion of Invulnerability or a cleric to use the Dispel Magic ability of Carsomyr.\nIf you use this glitch on a gem, you can set the gem's count number from 1 to 0. If you do it once more, the gem's count number will underflow and become 65,535. Selling the stack of gems will net tens of thousands at minimum, and can be done quickly and indefinitely. In BG1 and IWD, this can also be done with potions by holding the potion in the inventory screen before the character attempts to drink it. In IWD2, this can also be done to duplicate Oils of Fiery Burning, or any scroll that can be cast on the ground and not just on a living target.\nThis no longer works in the Enhanced Editions.\nRejiek Hidesman Trick.\nWhen you attack Rejiek Hidesman in his home, you get about 29,000 XP when he delivers a few brief lines of dialogue. If you surrounded him with party members before you do this, preventing him from moving, and then repeatedly click him after the dialogue ends but before he can go downstairs, you can get that 29,000 XP over and over again without limit. If you click him too soon, you won't get the XP from the previous dialogue.\nNo longer possible in EE.\nRestoring Clones.\nCasting Restoration on a Simulacrum clone will bump it up to the original caster's level. In the case of sorcerers, it will even give the clone the same spell slots as the caster.\nIn EE, clones are immune to restoration and this trick no longer works. They are also, however, immune to &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt;.\nRighteous Wrath of the Faithful Trick.\nIn the original Icewind Dale, before the Enhanced Edition, Righteous Wrath of the Faithful stacks with itself, granting +1 APR to characters with the same alignment as the caster. Combined with haste effects (only possible by casting Haste and RWF in the right order, or using Oils of Speed), and any party with a uniform alignment can attain 10 APR with large damage bonuses. If the party is composed entirely of gnomish cleric/illusionists, they can also attain immunity to RWF's crippling fatigue penalties by each donning a copy of the Helm of the Trusted Defender sold in Kuldahar. Level 15 druids are also immune to fatigue by default.\nRod of Terror Trick.\nUsing the Rod of Terror has a chance of permanently decreasing the user's Charisma by 1, which is fatal when CHA reaches 0. But by wearing the Ring of Human Influence, one can avoid this instant death effect until the character's Charisma underflows up to 25. This 25 Charisma lasts even when the ring is removed.\nTesting suggests this is no longer possible in EE.\nScorcher Loop.\nYou can multiply the effects of an &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; spell (or a Lance of Disruption in IWD:EE) by having two mages cast (Minor) Spell Turning and then casting Agannazar's Scorcher targeting each other. The spell turning effect will bounce the scorcher multiple times until it is exhausted. Spells in sequencer strike as a single spell, so putting three scorchers in a Spell Sequencer and combining it with two mages with Spell Turning will deal about 800 damage. Wands of Fire also work.\nThe spell is extremely party-unfriendly, and both mages will suffer fire damage if they are not immune (note that MGOI will block the damage, but also cancel the loop).\nThe Ring of Energy will also work.\nIn IWD:EE, you can actually lower enemy fire resistance using the level 3 priest spell Protection from Fire, which sets fire resistance to 80%.\nShapechange Trick.\nKilling a character under the effects of Shapechange, resting, and then resurrecting the character will preserve the shapeshifting abilities from Shapechange. Thus, any character who can cast Shapechange at least once can retain the abilities permanently, except for the main character, who cannot be killed without ending the game. An early way to cast Shapechange is to use the one-time-only Limited Wish Shapechange option. You can also use CTRL-R to preserve the effects, though this requires using the console.\nYou can backstab using the Iron Golem's attack, which deals 4d10 base damage.\nThis trick no longer works in the current version of the Enhanced Edition. There is, however, a complicated workaround (see EE section above).\nSlayer Trick.\nCasting Mirror Image can block the final 1500 magic damage that triggers 44 seconds after entering Slayer form. After surviving that damage, you can maintain Slayer form indefinitely. You can also use the spider gnome trick to remove the Slayer's natural weapon using a Shocking Grasp Minor Sequencer or scroll, or casting Minute Meteors via an EE-exclusive robe. You will then be able to attack using any weapon while still in Slayer form (though you will no longer have the Slayer's immunities to various disabling effects).\nOne of the EE v.2.x updates removed this trick.\nSpider Gnome Trick/Shocking Grasp Trick.\nBy switching to the spider form from Polymorph Self and then using a Shocking Grasp spell put in a Minor Sequencer, any mage can set his or her attacks per round to 4 using any weapon, as Shocking Grasp removes the spider's natural weapon, but does not return the mage to natural form. It works especially well with cleric/mages and Jan Jan's Flasher Master Bruiser Mates, as it cures one of their primary weaknesses: low APR. The high APR actually allows Jan to reliably stun-lock Kangaxx.\nAs of one of the v2.x updates, the spider gnome trick no longer works in BG2:EE.\nStackable Bard Songs.\nBard songs stack with themselves. By casting multiple Mislead spells and having each Mislead clone sing a song, you can stack the bonuses for the entire party. This works best with Skalds and the Enhanced Bard Song.\nRemoved by EE v2.3, only different type of songs stack.\nStackable Hardiness.\n&lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; stacks with itself, activating three uses will allows warrior classes to gain 120% physical resistance, they actually heal from being hit by physical attacks.\nNo longer possible in EE.\nSuldanessellar Pause.\nAfter the battle with Irenicus in the Abyss, the player is transferred back to Suldanessellar for a cutscene. If the player is quick enough, he/she can pause the game. This prevents Ellesime's script from triggering, which removes the player's ability from initiating action. The player must then attempt to talk to Ellesime, but veer off at the last second, and repeat this until Ellesime's script breaks and she no longer attempts to initiate dialogue. Talking to Ellesime after her script has broken will resume the cutscene, but the party can also kill the elves present in the room, although doing so will prevent the proper ending of the game.\nIf you hate Ellesime and lament the inability to kill her at any point in the story, this is your one and only chance to do it without the game preventing or punishing you for it.\nReequipping Items as the Slayer.\nWhen transformed into the Slayer, the player's magic resistance is set to 40. Removing and reequipping items such as Balduraan's Cloak will reapply the cloak's bonuses to the new form. This is because items such as the cloak merely add or subtract stats to the player's character sheet, while items such as armor set the stat to a certain amount. May not work in TOB or EE.\nSuper Slayer.\nIt is possible to transform into a golden, glowing, bloodlusted and virtually invincible Slayer through the interaction of several bugs. In this form, the player is a one-man holocaust capable of wiping out so many enemies in \"endless spawning\" areas such as Yaga-Shura's camp or Sendai's North Tunnels, it breaks the scripts and stop spawning monsters. Yaga-Shura himself, despite being immortal, will fail his save versus fear and flee in terror should the player damage him enough and/or slaughter his army in front of him. Even CLUA console summoning armies of dragons, liches, Ascension bosses or even Improved Demogorgons, fall faster and harder than logs to a lumberjack's axe.\nThe transformation requires a wizard to abuse Find Familiar and the Export bug, to raise his/her max HP above 700. Ideally, if the player has the patience, it should be 2500+ HP to max out the effect. Then, the player uses Chain Contingency and sets target to \"self\" and condition to \"on sight\", with two Tenser's Transformation and one Improved Haste selected. Transfom into the Slayer and find a hostile.\nThe contingency will trigger, giving the player over 1500 HP. Then, the player has to wait out the damage checks and absorb the 1500 damage dealt by the final check. The player will lose the \"slayer claw\" weapons and regain use of their primary weapon, while retaining the Slayer's 25/25/18 stats, 4 attacks/round, and magic resistance.\nWhile in the \"Super\" form, where the Slayer is golden and under the effects of dual Tenser's Transformation and Improved Haste, the player has 8 attacks/round, a THAC0 in the -40's, a -24 AC, and (depending on how much HP starting), [&lt;a href=\"Tel%3A1000-9999%7C1000-9999\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] HP. Even with a magic resistance of 40, it is almost impossible to take damage, let alone take die, and the player is capable of shredding large armies of enemies in seconds due to the high attacks, accuracy and enormus damage output. Using the Staff of the Magi, which functions as a +5 weapon, the player can hit any opponent in the game while continuously turning invisible and disspelling all protective magic.\nThe form is especially deadly with Erinne Sling +4 and the Bag of Plenty +2, using a basic script such as \"attack nearest enemy\". This combination arms the Super Slayer with a gattling gun, as the player no longer has to move within melee to massacre enemies. +4 bullets will kill Kangaxx, Melissan, Demogorgon, and anything that dares breath air within 6 seconds. Even normal bullets will do 24-30 damage to bosses per bullet, and with 8 per round, there is a high chance of a critical hit.\nEven after the \"super\" mode ends, the player will remain in the normal Slayer form after sleeping, retaining their high natural HP but losing the ability to regenerate damage if their natural Constitution is above 20. The form is not indefinite, there is a high but almost unreachable in realistic conditions timer set as the transformation's duration. Item-cast spells such as the Improved Haste or Improved Invisibility, from the Improved Cloak of Protection +2, can still be used in the Slayer form.\nTenser's Transfomation and Improved Haste are still subject to dispelling, but this is usually not a problem as the Super Slayer kills enemies too quickly for a dispel to be successful, has the speed to outrun non-targeting dispelling projectiles, and (if using a sling) the ability to inflict damage beyond the range of the spell's reach.\nAll Slayer forms terminate when exiting the map, as there is a script in place that ends the transformation for key events, cutscenes or moving from place to place, intended to prevent the transformation from killing the player while they are unable to end the form. This forced reversion is not present in the Shadows of Amn maps.\nThe transformation can be achieved in Shadows of Amn without Throne of Bhaal installed, but its ferocity is not as evident because there are fewer impressive enemies to rip apart, as Slayer Change is not obtained until returning from Spellhold, and Level 9 spells must be cast from scroll, so Chain Contingency has limited usage compared against the expansion.\nIf you ever wanted to know what Bhaal would be like in-game, this is basically it.\nThe bugs abused:\nTenser's Transformation: doubles the player's original HP, not their current HP (set to 100 as the Slayer), and stacks with itself since it wasn't meant to be cast again while in the transformed state. This also gives the signature golden glow.\nFind Familiar: gives a permanent HP boost that is retained if the character is exported.\nChain Contingency: No casting time, so it is an abusive way to cast three spells at once.\nSlayer transformation: To kill the player after staying in the Slayer form too long, BioWare chose to deal 1500 irresistible damage to the character in lieu of using the kill op code, which could fail under certain circumstances. Since the game was not designed to have a player with HP that high, it was guaranteed to work outside of the situation described above.\nLine of Sight: The player must move out of line of sight to successfully set up the Chain Contingency without triggering it in wizard form. Potentially, this allows the Super Slayer to be achieved multiple times per battle but requires tricky maneuvering to prevent premature ignition.\nUniversal Stealth Trick.\nBy mapping stealth to a hotkey, any character can attempt to hide in shadows, though characters who are not thieves, rangers, and monks will have poor stealth scores."}

As mentioned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Fadell%20Ironeye\"&gt;her journal&lt;/a&gt; found in her room at the barracks, she's disgruntled with the low pay offered by &lt;a href=\"Lanneth\"&gt;Lanneth&lt;/a&gt; and hazardous work, which has led to the death of several of her men. There are some Journal entries that will update:\nIf engaged in conversation, there is much dialogue available with some measured questions and the correct replies. The party can learn much about the Red Wizards here in Athkatla, including Lanneth, and how they ended up with this place within Waukeen's Promenade.\nFadell can either be persuaded to revolt by mentioning the names of her lost men, to which she raises a glass each time, or buying some rounds for the whole room from either &lt;a href=\"Mironda\"&gt;Mironda&lt;/a&gt; or a Bartender managing the tavern, depending on if one did her quest. This leads Fadell and her men to revolt against the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wizard\"&gt;Red Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and leave the enclave. There is a journal entry update when you gain information about the fallen mercenary comrades:\nThough she will return at the start of the battle with Lanneth, threatening to kill her. But after learning who had a hand in killing her men at &lt;a href=\"Delosar%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Delosar's Inn&lt;/a&gt;, she will simply leave Lanneth at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;. There will be a Journal update when She has given the order to attack the Red Wizards:\nIn a more calculated and cynical plan, the party can get the mercenaries to revolt, and then at a certain opportune time, begin attacking them \"and\" the Red Wizards, putting the whole place to the sword. There is no reputation penalty for that action, although it is a riskier proposition. If the party attacks the mercenaries the Journal will update:\nIf in battle with Fadell, she is a competent warrior with considerable skill in melee combat equipped with enchanted arms and armor. Her supposedly drunken state has only renewed her vigor.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; are scripted to be used. She may consume a Potion of extra healing when her HP falls to 50%."}
