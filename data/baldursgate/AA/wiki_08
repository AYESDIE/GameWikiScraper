It has no mage spells. It is equipped with different undroppable items to change its abilities and immunities. It can see invisible creatures and can't be backstabbed. It now has a casting time modifier with a +10-speed bonus, and spells will cast almost instantly. It has a movement modifier bonus of +4. It has a hidden helmet that gives it a Wings Animation and prevents critical hits. The creature gets a revised and smarter AI, and occasionally uses Divine Spells while engaged in melee or if enemies are present, automatically. The player can still control the Fallen Deva to command his spell casting as desired. As a Cleric, the Fallen Deva may be directed to Turn Undead using its appropriate button control. \nThe Fallen Deva is assigned a different animation than the unmodded game, looking more like a humanoid infernal angel with blood-red wings, and not the same as a Solar.

His primary attack acts like a &lt;a href=\"Harm\"&gt;Harm&lt;/a&gt; spell, reducing whomever it hits to 1-6\u00a0HP regardless of their previous total, \"then\" inflicting an &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Drain\"&gt;Energy Drain&lt;/a&gt; effect (Undead Hunters are immune) which causes a further 1-4 point constitution drain, potentially killing the target from further hit point loss. If they survive that, they then have to save vs. death. To avoid this, use hit-and-run ranged attacks with magical projectiles, as he is immune to normal weapons.\nTreasure: Mal-Kalen carries no treasure of any kind and gives up only 2000 experience points (given the difficulty of the fight, it seems lacking.)"}

He will appear as soon as any party member with the protagonist is in possession of certain items belonging to Drizzt and his loyal band of compatriots. In fact, lore states that Malchor initially provided Drizzt with his famous scimitars.\nGameplay.\nIn chapters 6 or 7 of , if the party has any of the following items, Harpell will visit the party via teleportation in any outdoor area:\nAssuming some of the gear above is in possession of the party. Malchor will teleport into any outdoor area the party is in (such as Waukeen's Promenade or the Umar Hills etc.) He'll initiate dialogue, which differs depending on if Drizzt and company perished in battle with &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Tombs\"&gt;Lower Tombs&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bodhi%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Bodhi's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, or if the party slew Drizzt's party in the wilderness area.\nHarpell greets the party, introduces himself and briefly explains that he is here to collect the gear belonging to Drizzt and his friends.\nThe party can basically agree and hand it over, whereby Harpell says thanks and all the gear is automatically removed from the &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;Inventory&lt;/a&gt;. He'll walk away and disappear from the map.\nIf the party refuses, Harpell has a disappointed line of dialogue, but all the gear is still removed from the party's inventory, and he walks away, and disappears from the map.\nDuring this action the party cannot act, because of the dialogue exchange. \nThere are additional dialogue and appearances of Melchor accounted for if the party tries to do something tricky. Such as dropping the gear just as Harpell teleports into the map. If that is done before he can initiate the dialogue, then when he does address the party, he'll have different line and say he needs to check on the whereabouts of Drizzt and he'll walk away. However as soon as the gear is picked up and back in the party's possession, Harpell will teleport in again (even on the same map). If Harpell ever gets a chance to initiate dialogue, and any of the gear is in the party's inventory, then Harpell will be able to reclaim those items.\nShould the party be splitting up its possession of the gear over several Harpell visits, and keeps dropping them on the ground, or transitioning to a new map just as he teleports in and other evasive maneuvers, it won't stop him from continuing to teleport into the party's location whenever any of the items are possessed.\nMalchor may state:\nOnce Malchor has spoken initially to the party, his script keeps track of the initial conversation and attempt to get the items, and any subsequent meetings will have a sterner and unforgiving tone - this will occur for instance if the party observes Melchor teleporting in (because they have the gear), and then pauses the game, dumps the gear on the ground, and then pretends they don't have the items. \nHe will be polite, at first and ask for the items be given to him (it seems through dialogue he intends to resurrect Drizzt). If the party refuses or says they don't have the gear then Malchor has several lines that are letting the player know that time is running out or that some conflict is approaching, including:\nThe final instance of the party refusing or giving Malchor the run around he'll say:\nMalchor's &lt;a href=\"Imoen%27s%20Belt\"&gt;special belt&lt;/a&gt;, that cannot be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed, makes him death proof. In addition, he can see invisible creatures, an that cannot be blocked or &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispelled&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; keeps trying to avoid the incident, for example by trying to drop the gear to the ground or stash it into a chest or similar, Malchor will eventually \"ReallyForceSpell\" cast a mass &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; on the entire party, thus potentially ending the game.\nIf the party gets into a combat situation with Harpell, then he behaves as a high-level mage, and will attempt to destroy the party. If the party flees the area, he will follow to the next outdoor area, and again and so forth. As the game has provided him with the undroppable &lt;a href=\"Imoen%27s%20Belt\"&gt;Immunity Belt&lt;/a&gt; item, his list of immunities and invulnerability to hit point destruction and instant death effects make defeating Harpell nearly impossible. Really, the sane thing to do is not to tempt fate and try and get this gear (it isn't so great at this stage of the game, and certainly better can be found in later chapters or is already in the party's inventory). However, players may see this as a challenge, and can be stubborn - so do as you will. If the entire party is affected by a mass &lt;a href=\"Imprisonment\"&gt;Imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; spell, you'll know it was all in vain. \nIf the Imprisonment spell is somehow defended against by &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt;, Harpell will continue following and attacking the party from area to area in Chapter 6 and 7. \nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; revises Harpell, and especially with the Smarter Mage component. He may be assigned a different mage kit (randomly decided on mod install, such as Enchanter, Invoker, or Necromancer). His memorized spells will differ as a result. He'll have a ready to go &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Sequencer\"&gt;Minor Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; scripted to deploy. Expect a vast array of \"Previously Cast\" protective buffs the first tics of combat that can't be interrupted. At least one mage &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; can be used during the battle, determined by the game difficulty settings."}

Marek tells them to leave or there will be dire consequences. What the protagonist replies to him has no effect on the outcome of the quest. However, if Marek is attacked and killed there, then he can never poison the party and the quest is avoided.\nThe actual quest begins when the protagonist meets Lothander in the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace%20%28Baldur%27s%20Gate%29\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt; in the district of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Central Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.

At this point the ten day quest timer has just begun and the Marek and Lothander quest will be entered in the quest section of your Journal (see below).\nA slight hope.\nLothander tells the party he has the antidote but he will only give it to them if they will help to release him from a geas that binds him to the Iron Throne's service. If the party tells him \"No\" he leaves, and they will not be able to talk to him again, resulting in their death from poisoning later on, which cannot be cured and ends the game. Killing him or pick pocketing him will also result in death as the cure he has on him is fake. If the player agrees to help him he leads the player to the &lt;a href=\"Diviner%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Diviner&lt;/a&gt; who he thinks can tell them how to break his geas. It costs 50 gold to get a reading for Lothander. The player can refuse but, again, it only results in the party's death.\nThe Diviner tells the party that only the high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Umberlee\"&gt;Umberlee&lt;/a&gt; can break the geas. When they inform Lothander of this, he tells them to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20and%20Stars\"&gt;Blade and Stars Inn&lt;/a&gt; when they have found a way to break the geas. The &lt;a href=\"temple%20of%20Umberlee\"&gt;temple of Umberlee&lt;/a&gt; (Labeled 'Water Queen's House') is located near the waterfront docks in the district of &lt;a href=\"South%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;South Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside the temple, speak to one of the priestesses and ask to see the high priestess, &lt;a href=\"Jalantha%20Mistmyr\"&gt;Jalantha Mistmyr&lt;/a&gt;. The party will need to bribe the priestess with 50 &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; to see Jalantha. She will tell them to wait, and after a few seconds the high priestess comes to speak with the party. She promises to help them break the geas if they will acquire the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Understanding\"&gt;Tome of Understanding&lt;/a&gt; for her.

Alternatively, Jalantha can be killed for the scroll, however this will interfere with other quests involving her (see &lt;a href=\"Tremain%27s%20Son\"&gt;Tremain's Son&lt;/a&gt;). Alternatively, you can pickpocket the Geas Removal Scroll and a Sphene Gem from Jalantha. You should still go and get the Tome of Understanding, but it will save you returning to Jalantha.\nRetrieving the Tome of Understanding.\nOnce inside the Lady's Hall, speak to Chanthalas Ulbright with your character who has the highest charisma. Tell him the party needs the Tome of Understanding. Ulbright will ask why he should give it up.

Each one recites a line or two of unique cryptic prose regarding their duty towards guarding the King's tomb. Immediately afterwards will turn hostile.\nEach Efreeti will most likely force cast a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; on self, then a force cast a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell at the closest opponent, and then force cast &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; on self.\nThe next two actions will probably be a force cast &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and then a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Fifteen game seconds will pass, and if the creature is able to function, will begin the cycle again. They never run out of spells, and can't be interrupted, silenced or affected by miscast magic effects (sorry Wizard Slayers). Note that their HD level is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring that brief waiting period it may engage in melee combat if there is a detected enemy.\nOnce its physical form is defeated, the being will disappear into a swirling vortex portal, leaving behind only a Piece of Burial Mask.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod rewrites the AI script for the creature and includes a revised set of spells it can cast and a better ability to recognize opponent protections and certain items worn by its enemies.\nAdditionally, the creatures are raised to 12 HD Efreeti, with caster level 12/12 mage-cleric ability. The Efreeti will use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; for protection several times, and &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;Flame Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;Magic Missile&lt;/a&gt; to attack with. Some of these can be used multiple times and others only once.\nThe guardian can instantly apply a &lt;a href=\"Fireshield%20%28Red%29\"&gt;Fireshield (Red)&lt;/a&gt; effect at will, even if removed it can reapply it.\nWhen damaged to a preset threshold the Efreeti will morph into a gaseous cloud form and rapidly regenerate. It is nearly invulnerable while gaseous. Once healed sufficiently, it reforms into an Efreeti and continues the fight. It can do this three times. Note that this creature will often turn invisible and move away from the chamber it is found in, and travel to backline party members. Closing the door after entering can prevent it from escaping, but all in the room will be exposed to AoE fire attacks."}

She is the Matron Mother of the House Despana.\nGameplay.\nFirst off, if the party enters the Temple of Lolth, and she is present there - and then dares to speak with the Matron Mother, the priestess will give a curt and harsh reply to NOT speak with her uninvited. This is a warning. If spoken to two more times, she will become hostile. So, don't speak with her unless you must through other dialogue introductions, such as if you are double-crossing Phaere, which is an option at a certain stage of the story line. The player will know they are headed in the wrong direction if she says: \"I have no interest in your questions, foolish &lt;MALEFEMALE&gt;. Begone! And do not interrupt me again!\"\nIn general, the Matron Mother gives the player character some quest actions and tasks relevant to the main plot of getting the protagonist and party back to the surface from the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Drow%20Summoning%20Ritual\"&gt;The Drow Summoning Ritual&lt;/a&gt; quest line:\nAfter these quests have been completed, &lt;a href=\"Phaere\"&gt;Phaere&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to entice &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; into betraying the Matron Mother. If this option is selected, and &lt;a href=\"Solaufein\"&gt;Solaufein&lt;/a&gt; is still alive, he will then offer the player the option to triple-cross both of the drow women.\nThere is more intrigue potentially with these lines of gameplay. The party can even report Phaere's plot to betray the Matron Mother directly to her.\nNote that it is unlikely that the party will actually ever be in direct combat with the Matron Mother in this saga, as that would cause hostility of the entire city of Ust Natha, and prematurely end all open pending quest actions.\nHowever, assuming the party does face the Matron mother in battle (it is possible), then she will force-cast a group of protective buffs at the outset to include &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Archons\"&gt;Shield of the Archons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Regeneration (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, and the use her &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Ring of Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt; to apply &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Minor Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next spell attempted will be &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. If her hit points fall to 40% or less, she'll regroup with a instant cast spell trio of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28priest%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire (priest)&lt;/a&gt;.

A projectile is launched toward that target, and if it successfully connects will expose the creature to a Maze effect.\nOnce the projectile connects, a 3D graphics effect (No. 215) plays over the target. There is a 4 second delay, and then the maze effect takes hold.\nThe targeted creature will now disappear from the area map for a duration as determined by a 2da file in the game code relating to the victim's intelligence attribute. Keep in mind that few enemy creatures have 18+ intelligence in BG2EE (especially among those who aren't outright immune to the spell), with most of them being: Mind Flayers/Ulitharids, Hive Mothers, some powerful demons (Balors, Mariliths and Cambions) and Mages (including monstrous Mages like Liches or the spellcaster vampire Tanova). So the vast majority of creatures are likely to remain mazed for 2d4 rounds or more.\nWhen the creature temporary removal is finished, the creature reappears in the same spot as when the maze effect took hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; can block this spell.

Otherwise he is affected as normal.\nOther defensive countermeasures include &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;Barbarian Rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Berserk (ability)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity: Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; (only against the mage version).\nThe Maze effect can be dispelled before it takes hold: After the spell is cast, there is a delay of several seconds during which a magical cage animation appears around the target, and only when this is complete will the spell actually take effect. If a successful &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; hits the target during this time, the Maze will not take effect; because time is critical here, this works especially well with &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic%20%28inquisitor%29\"&gt;Inquisitor's&lt;/a&gt; dispel magic, because it casts very quickly. But as the spell description says, Dispel Magic won't do anything if the target has already disappeared into the Maze. \nThe spell is not flagged as a \"Hostile\" spell, while some other game version maze effects are. This might be an error.\nTriva.\nIn the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset, the Wizard spell \"Maze\" can be escaped if using a \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Plane_Shift_%28Priest_Spell%29\"&gt;plane shifting&lt;/a&gt;\" spell.

Once turned back to flesh, she greets the party and offers her exceptional abilities as a warrior and enchanter in the forthcoming battles.\nHowever, as the skeleton mentioned, her oath doesn't last long \u2013 only fifteen rounds, after which she turns hostile towards the party.\nCombat.\nMeiala speaks the truth when saying, she had no peer among her people \u2013 her stats can only be compared with those of the &lt;a href=\"sirine%20queen\"&gt;sirine queen&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Isle of Balduran&lt;/a&gt;:\nIt should also be mentioned that her is not \"&lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;\", but \"&lt;a href=\"Humanoids\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;\" instead. So, any &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; with specific abilities related to these types will not behave the same as in other fights against sirines.\nNotes.\nRather than Improved Invisibility, which is the first spell usually cast by members of her kin, Meiala has a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; memorized. Unfortunately she's unable to use it.\n&lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed from the statue: first Meiala has to be resurrected. Though she turns hostile after fifteen rounds anyway, pickpocketing is still useful to obtain a quiver of twenty arrows of biting which otherwise might be fired off by her.\nAs with the other resurrected statue creatures, the party can choose to attack her before she turns hostile. She will not fight back, and will be easily killed."}

Anything of value to him he has warded magically anyway. That does not mean that other creatures in the area will not be hostile and attack the party, because they will.\nThis area is best explored when the party has accepted the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Haer%27Dalis%20from%20Imprisonment%20by%20Mekrath\"&gt;Free Haer'Dalis from Imprisonment by Mekrath&lt;/a&gt; quest.

Basically, it looks at both XP and game difficulty to determine what spawned creatures will be placed by the proximity trigger. Suffice to say, it is much more likely that the maximum difficulty level spawns in the unmodified game will be present for a visiting party even if party XP is only moderate. So, expect the highest spawn challenge with SCS installed.\nSCS revises all the creatures in the game to some extent, especially with smarter scripts. The Yuan-ti mages are a real eye opener for those not accustomed to facing SCS mages. Be advised, they are legit Level 14 spell casters, and thus are quite the challenge. Your party will be facing three of these most likely all at once. These creatures will do a much better job seeking out the party and pursing it. For example - Just launching a cloudkill into their spawn chamber will probably not be the final action needed to win the encounter, as they are scripted to chase down the party. Think through your tactics carefully."}

There's a lone &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; nearby and the chicken feels threatened. Melicamp must survive or this side quest is voided. If the party talks to the chicken before the wolf is killed, it will ask for their help. Once the wolf is killed the chicken will explain that he really is a human who tried to perform a spell that went wrong and he got transformed to this form. The party can attempt to dispel the magic but it won't work. The only option left is to take Melicamp to his 'master', &lt;a href=\"Thalantyr%20the%20Conjurer\"&gt;Thalantyr the Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hedge%20Estate\"&gt;High Hedge Estate&lt;/a&gt;. If you agree, the chicken will hop into your inventory as an item.\nPart 1: The first part of the quest has you taking the chicken to High Hedge, and speaking to Thalantyr (he may need speaking to twice, the first time he dismisses you). Tell him that you have a talking chicken. The conversation goes on for some time. At no point tell Thalantyr that you'll leave him to it, as this will leave the quest permanently incompletable.\nPart 2: Thalantyr tells you that he'll need the &lt;a href=\"skull\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; of an undead creature, and so begins the second part of this quest. Skeletons are a spawning creature in &lt;a href=\"High%20Hedge\"&gt;High Hedge&lt;/a&gt;, outside the estate. If you're having trouble finding some, try resting in the outdoors. Only the skeletons in the High Hedge area will provide you with the skull you need.\nCollect a skull from a skeleton and return to Thalantyr (or maybe you've sold one to him in the past but he forgot all about it and you can buy it back to give it to him). It is recommended that a save is made at this point because the reversal process might kill &lt;a href=\"Melicamp\"&gt;Melicamp&lt;/a&gt;; another way to render the quest permanently incompletable. Unless you want to take your chances.\nTalk to Thalantyr and he will cast the &lt;a href=\"Antichickenator\"&gt;Antichickenator&lt;/a&gt; spell. If it goes well and Melicamp is restored back to his human form, talk to the mage again to receive your reward. If it fails, Thalantyr will say that magic is unpredictable, that they shouldn't feel responsible for his death cause there was little more they could have done, and that the party should treat whatever magic items they happen to come across with caution and respect."}

However, if a mage in your party speaks with him there is some interesting dialogue, and more about the &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Rune\"&gt;Twisted Rune&lt;/a&gt; and ties to &lt;a href=\"Balthazar\"&gt;Balthazar&lt;/a&gt;.

No statistics or abilities are changed except as noted. They get an SCS combat script. They get proper fighter weapon proficiencies (grandmastery in long swords, two pips in Sword and Shield fighting style). The Haste effect is now set to &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IESDP\"&gt;IESDP&lt;/a&gt; effect 16 or &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt;, type 1.

They are initially encountered during the campaign.\nSome are found in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt; sewers in the &lt;a href=\"Illithid%20Hideout%20in%20the%20Sewers\"&gt;Mind Flayer's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, in the mind flayer dungeon in the &lt;a href=\"Underdark\"&gt;Underdark&lt;/a&gt; main caverns and specifically the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Tunnels\"&gt;Eastern Tunnels&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Illithid%20Encampment\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Illithid Encampment&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Enclave\"&gt;Sendai's Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sendai%27s%20Lair%20Mithykyl\"&gt;Sendai's Lair Mithykyl&lt;/a&gt; area. More are encountered in the during the &lt;a href=\"Hexxat%27s%20request\"&gt;Hexxat's request&lt;/a&gt; questline within the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Durkon\"&gt;Crypt of Durkon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome other types include the highly magic-resistant and spell-casting &lt;a href=\"Ulitharid\"&gt;Ulitharid&lt;/a&gt;s, vampiric illithids and the &lt;a href=\"Alhoon\"&gt;Alhoon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt; group is often found in areas with Mind Flayers and they carry no gold nor drop any treasure.\nCombat.\nWhile entering or joining a battle, Illithids typically use their innate psionic abilities to attack the party from a distance, potentially &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;charming&lt;/a&gt; one or &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;stunning&lt;/a&gt; several teammates. They tend to engage stunned victims in melee to devour their brains. Their melee attacks do negligible damage but drain 5 points of &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; on hit. Because creatures die when one of their &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;Ability Scores&lt;/a&gt; drops below 1, a Mind Flayer may kill a low-intelligence companion such as &lt;a href=\"Minsc\"&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt; in just two melee hits. The intelligence drain wears off on its own after 30 seconds. Mind Flayers are often accompanied and protected by Umber Hulks, who always use their Confusion ability while joining a battle and will use it again during combat. On rare occasions, Mind Flayers may also attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt; on the closest party member if they happen to be critically wounded.\nA bit of detail about the Mind Flayer Psionic attacks: The psionic attacks are ranged, cannot be interrupted and have a &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23C\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt; of 1. As they are not spells, but psionics, a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20protections%20type\"&gt;Spell protection&lt;/a&gt; such as Globe of Invulnerability or Spell Deflection has no effect on them. These attacks also ignore magic resistance. Both the &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Blast\"&gt;Psionic Blast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Domination\"&gt;Psionic Domination&lt;/a&gt; abilities can be negated by a saving throw. Once targeted and attacked by a Mind Flayer, there is a brief period of time for the innate psionic ability's projectile to travel to the target.\nStrategy.\nProtection against mind-affecting status effects.\nMind Flayers' ranged psionic attacks inflict &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Creature\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maze\"&gt;Maze&lt;/a&gt;, on targets who fail their saving throws. In addition, their pet &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt;s can inflict &lt;a href=\"Confused\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nThese status effects make party members easy pickings for the Mind Flayers' melee attacks (see the next section), so take precautions.\nHere are some ways to protect against all these status effects:\nVarious other measures protect against only \"some\" of these status effects:\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod has a specific component you can select that is focused on the Illithid, listed as \"Smarter Mind Flayers\" (BG2, BG2EE, BGT, EET). From the Mod's Readme:\nThis component improves the intelligence of the mind-flayers and their kin (specifically, it upgrades flayers, ulitharids, vampiric illithids, and the Master Brain). It allows the illithids to use a somewhat wider range of abilities than before (notably, they have access to a few physical psionic attacks, like Ballistic Attack, and they can astrally travel to more convenient bits of the battlefield); it significantly improves their targeting; it allows them to use each power every 2-4 rounds and choose the most appropriate available power; it lets them avoid attacking targets who are immune to their abilities or to their physical attacks.\nThe component also makes a few changes in how psionic powers work. It mildly increases the damage done by physical psionic attacks (though not to anything like the extent that Tactics does) and it changes \"anti-psionic\" items so that they do not protect from physical psionic attacks. (On my interpretation, \"Ballistic attack\" involves using psionics on a rock, not on a PC). This gives illithids a few more options when facing enemies who are shielded from mental attack. The component also systematizes illithid magic resistance and level, so that all of them are 90% magic resistant (previously there were a few exceptions) and the same level. As of version 16, it allows illithids' detonation power to destroy skeletons automatically (in accordance with the 2nd edition rules, as it happens).\nThe Mind Flayers described on this wiki page now have the following innate &lt;a href=\"Psionic%20Ability\"&gt;Psionic Ability&lt;/a&gt; powers, all of which can be used every 2-4 rounds:\nWith this mod and the \"Smarter Mind Flayers\" component installed, the differences between the original and EE game experience are noticeable during gameplay. The AI is significantly better. Mind Flayers will Astrally travel (Dimension door) adjacent to party members, especially unprotected ones in the rear, or left alone in a rear area. The illithids will use an Improved Invisibility power, often being invisible from the outset, and attacking from that state. Other changes include making the illithid a 12-HD creature, and their base THAC0 is improved to 12 for their melee attack. Also, the 100% elemental resistances are removed (again, to match up with the D&amp;D 2nd edition ruleset)."}

{"id": "4893", "revid": "285451", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4893", "title": "Minor Sequencer", "text": "The Minor Sequencer spell allows a caster to store two spells and activate them both at the same time as though they were an innate ability. The casting time for this ability is 1.\nGameplay.\nThe caster creates a \"Minor Sequencer\" by casting the spell on self.\nA brief casting animation plays out, and then a Minor Sequencer menu screen is displayed - the instruction reads \"ADD SPELLS TO YOUR SEQUENCER\".\nThe player may select up to two memorized spells from the 1st and 2nd level spell book(s) to add. If the caster has both Wizard and Priest spells, then any of those applicable spell choices can be selected (e.g. a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mage&lt;/a&gt; multiclass can also put Cleric spells in the Sequencer.)\nWhen all the spells desired are \"clicked\" on and entered, select the \"DONE\" button, and the minor sequencer creation animation graphic renders over the caster's sprite Additionally, an icon is placed on the character's portrait titled \"Minor Sequencer Active\". If you changed your mind about a spell you have selected, you can click on the selected spell to cancel it and choose another one in its place (before clicking \"DONE\").\nIn case a player has forgotten what spells have been placed inside the sequencer, they can find out by opening their Spell Book and clicking on the button \"CONTINGENCY\". This will display a list with all their spell sequencers, triggers and contingencies, showing which spells have been selected for each one.\nTo use the sequencer, for instance during a battle, select the character and the Special Abilities button (F12), which displays all the current abilities that can be selected. Click on the \"Minor Sequencer\" icon to activate it and designate a target.\nA mage can have one Minor Sequencer, one &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Sequencer\"&gt;Spell Sequencer&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trigger\"&gt;Spell Trigger&lt;/a&gt; each active at the same time but can't have two of the same type active at the same time.\nMoreover, if the required range of the two spells differs significantly, one of them will likely fail. In other words, the range at which the sequencer is released must be such that satisfies both spells' effective range. Also, the target of the sequencer must be an eligible target for both spells. For example, if a mage tries to cast Web followed by Invisibility with the same Minor Sequencer targeting the ground, only the Web part of the sequencer will work - however, if the mage targets themself, then both spells will work (the caster will be invisible with a Web centered on him). A player may have to practice this a few times to appreciate the dynamic of different ranged spells in a sequencer, so as to get them both to work.\nSince the duration is permanent until triggered, you can memorize the sequencer and the spells you want to put in it, cast it, then replace the used spells and rest. That way, you still have the trigger active after rest but also have more spell slots for the next encounter.\nSeveral spells that require the same type of &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; roll with the same modifier within the same short time frame will share a single roll instead of each having their own. This might be intended rather than a bug. Either way, sharing the same roll, they will fail or succeed in sync. If the player is trying to inflict a status effect like &lt;a href=\"Horror\"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt; for instance, two of the same spells shoved into a Minor Sequencer are no more likely to succeed than one. Note that persistent spells like &lt;a href=\"Web\"&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; will share a roll only in the first round. Subsequent rounds will force a save roll for both spells.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition ruleset has no spell titled \"Minor Sequencer\" - although there is a rare \"The Simbul's Spell Sequencer\" mentioned. This spell is a creation from Bioware for the BG game.\nMod content.\nRegarding this type of spell, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod will do the following, but only if you do not install &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;:\nMake spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages&lt;br&gt;\nIn the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc. are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency. This will not take effect if you have Spell Revisions installed (as SR takes care of this already by making them \"Universal\" School).\nWith &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; installed, this is the equivalent spell description:\nSimbul\u2019s Spell Matrix\nLevel: 4&lt;br&gt;\nSchool: Universal&lt;br&gt;\nRange: Personal&lt;br&gt;\nDuration: Special&lt;br&gt;\nCasting Time: 1 round&lt;br&gt;\nArea of Effect: Special&lt;br&gt;\nSaving Throw: None&lt;br&gt;\nThis spell allows a mage to prepare a magical matrix that can store spells to be used later in a single swift action. The matrix can store two spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 2nd level or lower.

For example, one to four (1d4) spell levels may be turned. The exact number is secretly rolled by the DM; the player never knows how effective the spell is. Also, ff the protected wizard and a spellcasting attacker both have spell turning effects operating, a resonating field is created that has variable bizarre side-effects, from fairly benign to catastrophic.\nBug.\nThis spell's coding has an error and is set to execute a \"Webbed\" portrait icon on the caster's portrait - fortunately the spell coding overrides this by the correct internal icon placement configured by Beamdog, which is \"hard coded\" into the actual spell.

He is initially found separated from &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt;, waiting just outside the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; within the southern town of &lt;a href=\"Nashkel\"&gt;Nashkel&lt;/a&gt;. Simply agree to help Minsc find his damsel and he will join the protagonist's party. Alternatively, you can find Dynaheir first in &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20Stronghold\"&gt;Gnoll Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; then bring her back to Minsc without ever talking to him.\nOnce Dynaheir has been rescued, the two of them are inseparable and require being together in the party, unless one of them dies or the player uses trickery to separate them.\nBe careful when recruiting him, as Minsc is a bit unstable, and turning down his offer of companionship can just as easily lead to a hostile confrontation.\nGameplay.\nMinsc's main drawback is that he can't use any magical scrolls or wands for he's one of the few companions with less than 9 &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; score, other two being &lt;a href=\"Yeslick%20Orothiar\"&gt;Yeslick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wilson\"&gt;Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. And while a &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; MUST have the company of a giant 'space hamster' such as Boo who can do just about EVERYTHING, it does takes up one quick item slots (and 1 lb), which could be a problem in original version of the game as time flows while you're managing items in inventory screen.\nHe does have a very high &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; stat though, making him an excellent mule at the very least, while also excelling with &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20Sword\"&gt;Two-Handed Sword&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Longbow\"&gt;Composite Longbow&lt;/a&gt;s. Minsc's racial enemy is &lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt; and he comes with &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Animal\"&gt;Charm Animal&lt;/a&gt; as all rangers, he has a unique &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;, an alternative version of &lt;a href=\"Fighter%23Berserker\"&gt;Berserker&lt;/a&gt;'s rage. Minsc is of course great in the front line, but if you use him as party leader, note that his low &lt;a href=\"charisma\"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt; will lead to higher prices when bargaining with merchants.\nRecruitment.\nMinsc is available to recruit from Chapter 7 (SoD) alongside with &lt;a href=\"Dynaheir\"&gt;Dynaheir&lt;/a&gt; on the second floor of &lt;a href=\"Three%20Old%20Kegs\"&gt;Three Old Kegs&lt;/a&gt;, after a short catch-up, they'll join your march towards the &lt;a href=\"Dragonspear%20Castle\"&gt;Dragonspear Castle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Caelar%20Argent\"&gt;Caelar Argent&lt;/a&gt;'s crusades, and like in BG1, he has to pair with Dynaheir and Boo.\n&amp;.\nIn , Minsc implies that he and Dynaheir had traveled with &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; for some time. At some point during this journey, they were set upon by the designs of &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Irenicus\"&gt;Jon Irenicus&lt;/a&gt;, only to be captured, imprisoned, and tortured.\nRecruitment.\nMinsc is available to recruit from &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20II%20Chapter%201\"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to have gotten off fairly well relatively, despite his partner Dynaheir supposedly being killed sometime during the initial confrontation, and finds himself imprisoned - much like Jaheira - within a nearby cage, though it appears to have no lock. To free him, the player must enrage him to the point that he bends the bars of his cage, after which he will take notice of the player's cleverness and will gladly join the party.\nMinsc will travel to the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Slums%20District\"&gt;Slums District&lt;/a&gt; if freed from his initial imprisonment, yet later removed from the party.\nAs in previous games, Boo is his stalwart companion and is a permanent part of his inventory.\nIn Enhanced Edition he starts at level 7 Specialized in Longbow, Mace, Two-Handed Sword and Two-Weapon Style.\nGameplay.\nCompared to the first game, Minsc has one more point in &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;. His racial enemy has changed to &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; and his alignment has also changed slightly, presumably due to the deaths of close friends, now exhibits a chaotic-good alignment - though this is largely inconsequential. Given that his original enemy was Gnolls, by which Dynaheir had been taken captive, it would make a certain amount of sense for the backstory to be that her death was at the hands of a vampire (almost certainly Bodhi or one of her brood, considering the role they play in BG2): however, this is never actualy confirmed.\nMinsc is the only companion other than &lt;a href=\"Dorn\"&gt;Dorn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Valygar%20Corthala\"&gt;Valygar&lt;/a&gt; that can use &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20Easthaven\"&gt;Defender of Easthaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; - making him an excellent physical damage tank.\nMuch like the first game, he still can't use any magical items other than weapons and armor without &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; boost, and &lt;a href=\"Boo\"&gt;Boo&lt;/a&gt; once again is kept in one of his quick-slots. His other abilities remain intact.\nHe still has his unique &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28ability%29\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt; ability, different from the &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Berserker's Enrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20Rage\"&gt;Barbarian's rage&lt;/a&gt; and Wilson's &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Rage\"&gt;Animal Rage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nMinsc is kind-hearted, has good intentions, and absolutely loves to be the hero, even willing to throw himself into danger to do what he believes is right. He does seem a bit mentally uncontrollable though, sometimes rushes into aggression behaviors towards anyone too fast without rational thinking, which often ends up getting him into trouble and avoidable conflicts as he mindlessly throws himself into combat. This is reflected by his exceptional physical stats but poor mental stats."}

It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.

The duplicate cannot engage in any other actions other than movement.\nThe duplicate retains the caster's basic hit points and final armor class rating (modified by equipped items) as the caster has at the time of the spell casting. However, spell or potion effects such as &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Armor\"&gt;Spirit Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Power\"&gt;Potion of Power&lt;/a&gt; etc. active on the caster are not duplicated on the mislead clone.\nWhen the spell expires, the duplicate disappears from the map.\nA very powerful spell that lets the player's characters perform any actions (including attacks) without breaking the invisible state, as long as the decoy\u00a0is not destroyed.\nAs the invisibility conferred by this spell isn't broken by overt action, every melee attack from an eligible class (&lt;a href=\"Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt;) can potentially be a &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;, even those made by the offhand!\nExposing only the caster to a Dispel / &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; etc. will not end the Mislead - it's the decoy that has to be affected by them.\nCreatures who have the &lt;a href=\"See%20the%20invisible\"&gt;See the invisible&lt;/a&gt; ability can target the caster, as long as the caster is in detection range, even if the mislead clone is out of detection range. The spell, however, is not completely useless against those creatures, because the caster will retain the \"coming out of invisibility\" THAC0 bonus of 4 on every attack and backstab-eligible classes will still be able to backstab those creatures with every attack, if positioned behind them.\nWhen the game AI uses this spell (and it will do so regularly), the mislead illusionary duplicate will not move or engage in any action from the point it was created. It merely acts as a stationary decoy, to potentially confuse or occupy the opponent's attention.\nNote.\nThis spell actually uses the hardcoded Simulacrum mechanics to create a mislead clone.\nThis spell was nearly revised back in 2016 by Beamdog, to reduce its &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology\"&gt;Cheese&lt;/a&gt; factor. Fan feedback to the proposed changes left the spell's design intact. It is up to the player to decide how far they will push the mislead spell's use - the AI has little ability to handle it, therefore it can be very overpowered, and unbalances the game design.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Wizard spell \"Mislead\" enables the illusion of the wizard to speak and gesture as if it were real, and there are full olfactory and touch components as well. However, unlike the BG game's implementation, a detect invisibility or true seeing spell or items such as a gem of seeing or robe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects, duration and description. See below:\nMislead\nLevel: 6\nSchool: Illusion\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: Caster\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after 6 rounds and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. As long as the image isn\u2019t destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion."}

He gives the player 300 &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gp&lt;/a&gt; up front and promises 1000 more upon completion of the quest.\nDirections.\nTo reach &lt;a href=\"east%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;east Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt; from the Flaming Fist HQ, head east through the &lt;a href=\"South%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"southeast%20Baldur%27s%20Gate\"&gt;southeast Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. East Baldur's Gate has many sewer entrances. There are three around &lt;a href=\"Sorcerous%20Sundries\"&gt;Sorcerous Sundries&lt;/a&gt; to the west and one to the northeast between &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Aello%27s%20Discount%20Store\"&gt;Lucky Aello's&lt;/a&gt; and the abandoned house. No matter which entrance the player chooses, they will come out in same part of the sewer. The only difference is which side of the room the party ends up on, which may have some strategic application.\nSewers.\nOnce in the &lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20Sewers%20East\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;, the party will be confronted by an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Mage\"&gt;Ogre Mage&lt;/a&gt; who claims responsibility for the missing people. He used his &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Crawler\"&gt;Carrion Crawler&lt;/a&gt;s to kill them and bring them to the sewers, where he looted the bodies and then fed them to his pets. After explaining his \"fiendishly clever\" scheme he attacks the party. Once dead, the ogre mage drops and some &lt;a href=\"random%20treasure\"&gt;random treasure&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ring\"&gt;Ruby Ring&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%2B1\"&gt;Bastard Sword +1&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%2B1\"&gt;Scimitar +1&lt;/a&gt; .\nTo the west of the junction where the ogre mage was found, there are several silk sacks holding bodies. The first sack contains a &lt;a href=\"Male%20Body\"&gt;Male Body&lt;/a&gt;, a ruby ring, and 135 gp.\u00a0The second sack contains another male body, a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Protection\"&gt;Potion of Magic Protection&lt;/a&gt; and 51 gp. The third sack holds another male body and only 28 gp , or additionally contains a &lt;a href=\"Ninjat%C5%8D%20%2B1\"&gt;Ninjat\u014d +1&lt;/a&gt; . The last sack contains two male bodies, some &lt;a href=\"Murky%20Oil%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Murky Oil of Speed&lt;/a&gt; and 85 gp.\nIn the classic version of the game it doesn't count which of these or perhaps even other ruby rings is brought back to Scar for an extra reward of 3000 gp. In the Enhanced Edition this was changed, however, and only &lt;a href=\"Sashenstar%27s%20Ruby%20Ring\"&gt;Sashenstar's Ruby Ring&lt;/a&gt; (item code codice_1), dropped by the ogre is accepted.\nCompletion and Outcomes.\nReturn to Scar at the Flaming Fist HQ to complete the quest and collect the reward. Selecting option two (which explains the ogre mage's motivation for the killings) yields the greatest reward, as it allows the player to return the noblewoman's ring to get an extra bonus. Option three leaves out the motive and is apparently less pleasing to Scar, but still yields the agreed-upon reward of 1000 gp and 1000 XP.\nIf the player speaks to Scar and does not have the ruby ring, they will not be able to return it or collect the bonus. \nStrategy.\nThe ogre mage is capable of casting &lt;a href=\"Confusion%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Confusion&lt;/a&gt; and summoning spells. The best strategy is to stop him from casting anything at all by killing him as soon as possible. &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Slaying\"&gt;Arrows of Slaying&lt;/a&gt; are ideal if they are available. Alternatively, having a mage cast &lt;a href=\"Agannazar%27s%20Scorcher\"&gt;Agannazar's Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; on him will speed things along considerably. Though the carrion crawlers will likely paralyze some party members before the ogre mage is killed. It may be advisable to keep a healer in ranged combat so they can heal paralyzed party members if it becomes necessary.\nMod content.\nUnfinished Business mod.\nOne of the components of Unfinished Business adds additional text to this quest and requires that players retrieve the noble's body as well as her ring for a reward. If the player speaks to Scar with the signet ring but without the noble's body, Scar will ask them to return to the sewers and search for it, promising an extra bonus. If the player refuses to return for the body, Scar will express his displeasure but will give the player a 500 gp bonus and 3000 XP. When both the ring and the body are returned to Scar, he rewards the player with 4000 gp and 3000 XP."}

It also has the innate &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Ball\"&gt;Mist Ball&lt;/a&gt; ability. \nThe mephit will initiate the \"Mist Ball\" attack, which launches a sparkling projectile at a target in range and it deals damage. In addition, the attack obscures the target's vision, and induces a &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; status effect lasting 10 seconds. A &lt;a href=\"Saving%20throw\"&gt;Saving throw&lt;/a&gt; vs. Breath Attack will negate the magical energy damage, but there is no save against the blindness effect. \nThe Mist Mephit can attempt this innate ability as soon as an enemy is detected and if within range. After the initial launch, at least two rounds may pass before attempting another one. After every 5 rounds after the initial launch, the creature reevaluates the available targets and starts the cycle over, although it is unlikely the fragile creature will survive that long, as the mephit is also scripted to engage in melee combat as well. \nThe Mist Mephit has no magic, physical damage or elemental resistance. The InfoBox summarizes their special abilities and immunities to certain status effects. The game has the creature with a memorized &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt; spell but it isn't scripted to use it, so it is probably just a developer creature file copy-paste remnant.\nNotes.\nThe game files provide for a Mist Mephit &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;, however this type is not implemented for use in an unmodified game."}

The entrance is guarded by a group of hostile level 12 mercenaries. Up ahead, there will be a dead end where there are four prisoners, one of these being Mizhena's father. They are all guarded by two dogs and a level 8 fighter named &lt;a href=\"Therli\"&gt;Therli&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Therli and her dogs are eliminated, Urold approaches the player to thank him for the rescue. No matter which option Gorion's Ward chooses, it will end up asking him about his identity, linking him to Mizhena. Urold can become hostile if at the end of the conversation you choose the third dialogue option that states: \"I think not. A follower of Tempus proud of wasting in a cage? You disgust me and you shall not live to see my day's end.\"\nKilling Urold in any way, even after finishing neutral dialogue with him, will lose the rewards of the quest in exchange for 420 XP for his death (in addition to 5,000 XP for his release if he is not verbally attacked). \nHead to the central area of the castle courtyard to speak to Mizhena, who may be standing somewhere or wandering around the area, and notify her that her father has been freed to receive a reward of 2500 XP and the &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Glory%20%2B3\"&gt;Blazing Glory +3&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "6197", "revid": "50866439", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6197", "title": "Monk", "text": "This page is for the monk &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; in .\nIntroduction.\nMonks are spiritual ascetics and practitioners of a mystical energy known as \"ki\", the magical essence which flows through all living things. They are specialized in barehanded fighting. Monks are the only creatures in the game that have both a fist and leg kick combat animation.\nMonks use the &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Tables\"&gt;level progression&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Clerics&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attacks%20per%20round\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; progression of &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt;. This means they have the fastest THAC0 progression of all classes, since they level faster than Fighters (though only slightly). Additionally, Monks get lots of immunities, but as downside are very restricted in what gear they can use. Monks cannot wear armor or use shields and helmets. \nIn the Original Edition they can use cleric scrolls as well as many mage wands, including &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20Cloudkill\"&gt;Wand of Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt;, which has been disabled in Enhanced Editions (they can still use &lt;a href=\"Wand%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Wand of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;). In all editions, they can use combat-oriented &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; that are otherwise only available for Warrior classes.\nMonks have a limited access to some thieving skills and use the same weapons as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; that require one hand. These weapons can only be used with basic proficiency (1 point) and\u00a0may only assign a single point in single-weapon fighting style. There are a few hoods/cowls and or Ioun Stones that may be worn on the head slot by a Monk.\nThese disadvantages are compensated for by a an ever-cumulative number of different benefits as they level up.\nOnly humans may become monks.\nMonks may not &lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbility scores table.\nDuring character creation, rolls below the minimum value for the class will be increased to that value. This table uses the values for &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMonks gain +1 strength from a Star result from &lt;a href=\"Deck%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;Deck of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being a combat-focused class, monks do not have expectional strength values (18/xx), they can start with max. 18.\n^^ The Dark Moon and Sun Soul class kits have an increased constitution minimum ability score.\nSpecial abilities of the monk.\n&lt;a href=\"Stunning%20Blow\"&gt;Stunning Blow&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnkitted monks can use Stunning Blow once per day for every four levels.\n&lt;a href=\"Quivering%20Palm\"&gt;Quivering Palm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a unkitted monk and Dark Moon Monk reaches the 13th level, they get the ability Quivering Palm.\n&lt;a href=\"Lay%20On%20Hands%20%28monk%29\"&gt;Lay On Hands&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnkitted monks and sun soul monks gain the ability to lay on hands at level 7.\n&lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonks have access to a limited set of &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Abilities\"&gt;Thieving Abilities&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"find%20traps\"&gt;find traps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hide%20in%20shadows\"&gt;hide in shadows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"move%20silently\"&gt;move silently&lt;/a&gt; and (Dark Moon only) &lt;a href=\"detect%20illusion\"&gt;detect illusion&lt;/a&gt;. Monks receive 10 points per level to spend on these skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20Traps\"&gt;Find Traps&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonks begin the game with a 5% chance to find traps (human racial bonus) which may be further modified by their dexterity score. Unlike thieves, monks may not attempt to disarm found traps. This skill does not benefit from scores higher than 100.\n&lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonks begin the game with 10 points in &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Move Silently&lt;/a&gt; and 5 points in &lt;a href=\"Hide%20in%20Shadows\"&gt;Hide in Shadows&lt;/a&gt; (both subject to &lt;a href=\"dexterity\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; modifiers). When performing a melee attack while hidden, Monks receive a +4 &lt;a href=\"THAC0\"&gt;THAC0&lt;/a&gt; bonus, but unlike\u00a0thieves, they do not receive any bonus to damage. See the &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; article for more information.\n&lt;a href=\"Detect%20Illusion\"&gt;Detect Illusion&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Moon Monk only).\nDark Moon Monks begin the game with 10% chance (kit bonus) to dispel non-friendly illusion spells within 30\u00a0ft whenever their Find Traps skill is active. This skill does not benefit from scores higher than 100.\u00a0\nLevel-dependent bonuses.\nUnarmed\u00a0attacks.\nMonks start with 1 attack per round. Every three levels until level 18, this is improved by 1/2 attack per round. At level 18, a monk can attack with his fists 4 times each round. Unarmed damage also increases by level. Additionally at level 9, the monk's fists are treated as +1 magic weapons, increasing to +2 at level 12, +3 at level 15 and +4 at level 25, including bonuses to THAC0 and damage. So for example at level 19, unarmed attacks would have a THAC0 of 2-3 = -1 and a damage of 1d20+3 (both further increased by Strength and relevant buffs). The spell &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapon\"&gt;Enchanted Weapon&lt;/a&gt; can also be applied to the fists (Enhanced Edition only), to hit enemies that require +3 weapons before level 15 (but the spell does not increase damage or THAC0). Monk unarmed attacks have an increased &lt;a href=\"Game%20Terminology%23R\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; of 2 ft like two-handed weapons. Unarmed attacks all come from the main hand, leaving it possible for an offhand weapon to be equipped, although no proficiency points may be put into two-weapon fighting.\nArmed attacks.\nMonks can't specialize in any weapon, so they can't get extra attacks per round due to proficiency. However, like Warriors, they gain half attack per round at levels 7 and 13. So the maximum attacks per round with a melee weapon will be 2 at level 13. Since Monks can't be hasted at that level, only weapons like &lt;a href=\"Belm\"&gt;Belm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ninjat%C5%8D%20of%20the%20Scarlet%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Ninjat\u014d of the Scarlet Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; will raise that number. Ranged weapons also gain the bonus in attacks per round, so a level 13 Monk will be able to throw 4 darts or 3 thrown daggers per round. Since Monks level up a bit faster than Fighters, their THAC0 will be the same or better than the one of a Fighter who is only proficient and has the same experience.\nArmor class bonuses.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Class\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt; of the monk is 9 at the start. This decreases by another point at level 2 and every two levels thereafter, until level 20. Subsequently, there are further single point bonuses at levels 24, 27, 30, 35 and 40. This results in a -6 for \"effective armor class\" if reaching level 40.\nDeflect Missiles:.\nThis gives a monk a -1 armor class bonus against missile attacks every three levels.\nSaving throw bonus.\nMonks have +2 bonus when they need to make saving throws against spells right from the start. At level 9, they gain +1 bonus to all saving throws. These stack allowing for +3 vs spells and +1 to all others.\nMagical resistance.\nAt level 14, Monks gain 42% &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; (which is 3% for every experience level thus far). A further 3% each level is gained up to a maximum of 78% at level 26. \nMovement modifier.\nMonks move +2 points faster than normal units from the start. They gain a +1 movement modifier boost for every five levels of additional experience as well.\nWeapon speed factor (determines when in a turn order the attack occurs):.\nAt level 8, they receive -1 bonus to speed factor. At level 12, a further -1.\nImmunities.\nAt level 5, they gain immunity to all diseases and cannot be hasted or slowed - they may not use Oils of Speed but may wear Boots of Speed. At level 9, they also become immune to &lt;a href=\"Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; charm as well. At level 11, they become immune to poison too. At level 20, they become immune to non-magical weapons.\nClass kits.\nMonk.\nMonks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best-known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.\nDark Moon Monk.\nThe Order of the Dark Moon is a secretive monastic order that follows the teachings of the dark goddess &lt;a href=\"Shar\"&gt;Shar&lt;/a&gt;. Monks of the Dark Moon use physical prowess, dark magic, and many different forms of deception to mask their activities and strike with deadly precision.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nSun Soul Monk.\nSun Soul Monks were once worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Amaunator\"&gt;Amaunator&lt;/a&gt; in the time of the &lt;a href=\"Netheril\"&gt;Netheril&lt;/a&gt;, but today their worship is divided between &lt;a href=\"Lathander\"&gt;Lathander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sel%C3%BBne\"&gt;Sel\u00fbne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sune\"&gt;Sune&lt;/a&gt;. Sun Soul Monks adhere strictly to the law, using their martial arts and magical abilities to drive out darkness and corruption wherever they find it.\nClass features.\nDisadvantages:\nHigh-level class abilities.\nMonks, who belong to priest group, use the warrior &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;HLA&lt;/a&gt; pool instead, except that they do not have access to the Resist Magic, as they already have 60% magic resistance by the time it becomes available. \u00a0\n&lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"The%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20has%20been%20Invaded\"&gt;The de'Arnise Keep has been Invaded&lt;/a&gt;, protagonist monks acquire the keep as &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20the%20de%27Arnise%20Keep%20and%20Lands\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, same as fighters.\nRelated items.\nExclusive &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s for monks:\nSome items that are exclusive to &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; and can be used by monks:\nWarrior and Monk exclusive items.\nHighly recommended items:\nGameplay (community).\n~ Write your insights below \u2013 different from the Gameplay section above, you may use your signatures here; this is an example page ~"}

They cannot move, attack, or use items. A playable character cannot be directly selected. They can receive items, but no items can be taken from their inventory. A creature Held is considered 'Helpless' by the game engine.\nBeing Held, or paralyzed is of a physical nature and therefore curable by &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Paralysis\"&gt;Remove Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Magic%20Blocking\"&gt;Potion of Magic Blocking&lt;/a&gt; would also cure the effect, but since the affected subject is unable to administer the potion, it is not a viable treatment. Hold Creature is implemented with three Opcodes in the game, and they are very similar in function. The historical official name labels in the game &lt;a href=\"IESDP\"&gt;IESDP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; library were as follows: \nState: Hold Creature I [109] (Current name: State: Paralyze) \nState: Hold Creature II [175] (Current name: State: Hold)\nState: Hold Creature III [185] (Current name: State: Hold II)\nUntil recently, there is no status effect state actually named 'Paralyze, Paralysis or Paralyzed' in the game engine. There are various associated string references with those terms, depending on the source of the status effect. \nSome explanatory views of these Opcodes in the game, are laid out by the Sword Coast Strategem's developer and author David W. from the Gibberlings Three EE Fixpack Discussion, March 2022, which is posted below:\nBeing Held, or Paralyzed is typically implemented using three different Opcodes:\n109: is used almost exclusively by items that cause paralysis, such as the undroppable weapons used by ghouls and carrion crawlers. The IDS check is rarely functional: you're affected by a 109 unless you have explicit protection from it. It is almost always associated with the 'Paralyzed' string. Many classes of monster - dragons and undead, for instance - are immune to it; you also get immunity to it from Free Action, Chaotic Commands, et al.\nComplicating matters, though, 109 is *also* used by Web spells, both in BG1 and BG2 (the 'mimic glue' effect in BG2 also uses it). This is actually unnecessary, at least in EE: the web effect (opcode 157) is invariably associated with Web, and it imposes the paralyzation condition all by itself. However, it's clear that Bioware *didn't know that* and thought 157 was cosmetic (and they may have been right: I'm not sure whether this is EE behavior). There are quite a number of places in BG1 and BG2 where it is fairly clear that creatures are given 109 immunity because they are supposed to be unaffected by webs. (It's fairly clear for wyverns, which have no obvious lore reason not to be affected by paralysis (and are big enough to look stupid when Web Effect Overlay plays over them) and have an item that blocks 109, 157, and Entanglement effects; it's equally clear for Kuo-Toa, who get similar immunities to implement their PnP slipperiness trait; it's probably true for Beholders, who can presumably float above webs but have no obvious canon reason to get paralysis immunity.)\n175: is used pretty much exclusively by paralyzing spells, almost always labelled 'Hold' (Tanar'ri paralysis is an exception) and is almost always associated with the 'Held' string. Creature immunity doesn't normally affect it: you get immunity to it through situational things like Free Action.\n185: is used *very* rarely, and very few things are immune to it. In vanilla BG1, *nothing* is immune to it, and the *only* spell or item which uses it is Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. I think the underlying idea is that 185 represents things that physically prevent you from moving, but through some external barrier rather than directly slowing or freezing you. (On this basis, players should never be immune to 185, and probably only minhp1 items should grant it, to avoid the usual scripting problems. In BG2, however, I think the logic of this breaks down quite badly: boss monsters get immunity to 185, but it gets granted by some items/spells that really shouldn't grant it (some but not all fixed in FP or EE). I think the designers kind of lost track of what they'd intended. They also use 185 to double up as a cutscene can't-be-blocked effect (e.g. HELL_HOLD), but that is (or should be!) harmless since players shouldn't be protected from 185 anyway.\nMod content.\nThe upcoming release of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/eefp/\"&gt;Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; has already beta coded a large overhaul pertaining to Held, as follows:\nRevamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web \nIn the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes).\nAs the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. \nEEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect."}

Is the reward still offered? What additional information might Pimlico have to help find it? And what about the bloodbath and vile words that Korgan referred to? \nBecause of the way this quest will unfold, the party only has one chance to speak with this Pimlico fellow before that opportunity will be shuttered later.

For a more detailed walkthrough, see the page for the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Dungeons\"&gt;Southern Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the Southern Dungeon, proceed to the southernmost room, and Korgan will notice that the tomb has already been looted, granting 11,250 XP shared by the party. If Korgan is within sight of the Mummy, there will be an exchange of dialogue between he and the animated undead creature. After clearing out the undead, you will want to hurry back to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt; and to the home of the Book Collector.

As you approach, Korgan tells you that the place has been looted.\u00a0Go inside, take Korgan into the bedroom and the murdered corpses of Pimlico and the two guards are seen. He'll mention that this looks like the work of &lt;a href=\"Shagbag\"&gt;Shagbag&lt;/a&gt;, who can probably be found on the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; (8,750 exp shared by the party).

If you defeat them, search Shagbag's corpse to find &lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Kaza\"&gt;The Book of Kaza&lt;/a&gt; which can then be sold for a tidy sum of gold.\nAchievements.\nThe Book of Kaza.\nTrack down the Book of Kaza for &lt;a href=\"Korgan\"&gt;Korgan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BuTcHeRy\"&gt;BuTcHeRy&lt;/a&gt; mod makes some changes to Shagbag and his goons.

Clara\u2019s presence is needed at some vital points in order to progress, thus it\u2019s advised to keep her in party before her inevitable departure.\nRecruiting Hexxat.\nHead over to the large tomb just east of the starting zone (x=2400, y=1850), where you\u2019ll encounter two shade thieves, you may avoid them showing up by picking the 2nd option in dialog with Clara.\nEnter the tomb, Clara will reveal a secret door, before you drag your party down into the depths, loot the sarcophagus (x=450, y=400) for &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Curing\"&gt;Staff of Curing.&lt;/a&gt;\nKilling two shade thieves at the &lt;a href=\"Dragomir%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Dragomir's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; entrance, head southwest to dispatch a &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Wolf\"&gt;Shade Wolf&lt;/a&gt; and disarm a trap, continue the way you'll encounter more Shade Wolves plus &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Shade\"&gt;Devil Shade&lt;/a&gt;s who can drain levels, and when they are close to death, spawn two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fiend\"&gt;Shadow Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s.\nContinue west ignoring east, disarming two traps as you go, find Dragomir's sarcophagus (x=1000, y=800). Hexxat will implore you to climb in. Before you do so however, loot another sarcophagus to the north-east, disarm a trap to the south-west beyond Dragomir's sarcophagus then explore down the tunnel, kill three Shadow Fiends, and loot another sarcophagus for &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Undead\"&gt;Protection From Undead&lt;/a&gt; scroll. Send someone with thieving skills into the sarcophagus (there\u2019s no limit how many people you may send, but you need to do it one at a time), disarm the trap down the way then talk to &lt;a href=\"Burich\"&gt;Burich&lt;/a&gt;. Kill him or convince him to hand over &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Rod\"&gt;Iron Rod&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack to the entrance, use the rod on the cylinder slot, a hidden wall south will open, locking the way out at the same time (you may interact the cylinder any time to reopen the seal, just be careful not to position anyone in the shadow zone behind the entrance else the wooden door will lock them within).\nGo through the newly opened wall, beware of the trap (x=2000, y=1020), continue the way and you'll eventually bump into &lt;a href=\"Dragomir\"&gt;Dragomir&lt;/a&gt;, whose death is required for Clara to dispel the purple light barrier for you (Dragomir is not able to detect &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, and is also bugged - you can lead him towards the southern purple light to trigger his trace back to his original position, he won\u2019t attack you at all after that). &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Dragomir\"&gt;Cloak of Dragomir&lt;/a&gt; will be dropped on ground once you killed its owner, either pick it up for an extra scene later, or leave it to be silently grabbed by Hexaat.\nHead south, then turn down a hallway west, send Clara the barrier will vanish.\nClara will permanently leave the party upon meeting Hexxat, who will then wait where you fought Dragomir (despite saying to meet her in the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt;). You may recruit her now if you don't have &lt;a href=\"Keldorn%20Firecam\"&gt;Keldorn&lt;/a&gt; in party, or purpose your offer again where she searches for Cloak of Dragomir, or just meet her later at Copper Coronet (keep your own pace as the \u201ctwo hours\u201d appointment limit she stresses doesn\u2019t actually exist). Seconds later upon joining, Hexxat will let you hold on &lt;a href=\"Dragomir%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dragomir's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, which is literally a &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Holding\"&gt;Bag of Holding&lt;/a&gt; with 99 free slots, very handy as you do not have to make sail to &lt;a href=\"Spellhold\"&gt;Spellhold&lt;/a&gt; or try and find one in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Watcher's Keep&lt;/a&gt; if your game installation allows early visits there.\nThe Claw of the Black Leopard.\nKeeping Hexxat in the party means submitting to various quests as delivered by her Master L, but you'll have to wait for about one week before the messages are delivered by &lt;a href=\"Cabrina\"&gt;Cabrina&lt;/a&gt;, rests &amp; travel both count towards the total time required, and Cabrina only appears at night, in the Athkatla streets other than the Graveyard District.\nAfter the encounter, go to the Graveyard District where Hexxat will initiate a dialogue asking if you are ready to tombwalk via &lt;a href=\"Casque%20of%20Dragomir\"&gt;Dragomir's Casque&lt;/a&gt;. Be warned that once you get teleported to &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Durkon\"&gt;Crypt of Durkon&lt;/a&gt; (OH7100) you'll have to either get hands on Claw of the Black Leopard\u00a0or dismiss Hexxat (which will cause both her and her quest to disappear until ToB) in order to return to Amn, so decline her offer, make sure you're ready to proceed, then manual talk to her while in Graveyard.\nHead south when arriving at Crypt of Durkon, loot sarcophagi and disarm a rather huge trap until you find a group of 'Ghostly Monks' led by one &lt;a href=\"Keno\"&gt;Keno&lt;/a&gt; (x=500, y=1020), agree to help them rid of underdark intruders so that you don't miss out an optional zone, an extra scene with Hexxat plus some xp. Go through the newly opened door next to Keno and fight &lt;a href=\"Umber%20Hulk\"&gt;Umber Hulk&lt;/a&gt;s then &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flayer\"&gt;Mind Flayer&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Goxxa%20the%20Alhoon\"&gt;Goxxa the Alhoon&lt;/a&gt; with the monks. If Keno survived, he'll give you &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20Scholars\"&gt;Key of Scholars&lt;/a&gt; we need to progress; If Keno died, but any other ghosts survived, the key will drop but you'll have to put the ghosts down here too.\nLoot the sarcophagi (x=1050, y=1300) for &lt;a href=\"Periapt%20of%20Life%20Protection\"&gt;Periapt of Life Protection&lt;/a&gt; and disarm traps as you go, with the key, open the door at (x=1900, y=1600). Open any sarcophagi nearby to awake five angry Greater Mummies to deal with, the middle sarcophagi (x=2100, y=1420) has &lt;a href=\"The%20Jade%20Fang\"&gt;The Jade Fang&lt;/a&gt; dagger. If Keno died, more ghosts will attack you from all sides along the way.\u00a0\nTake the east way to find &lt;a href=\"Ki%20Chin%20Sang\"&gt;Ki Chin Sang&lt;/a&gt; (x=1900, y=820) who holds &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Master%27s%20Crypt\"&gt;Key of the Master's Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. You can fight him for it. He will also hand it over voluntarily if you challenge the master's six 'most trusted lieutenants' in the hallway to the south. Accept the challenge for more xp: after you kill &lt;a href=\"Borok-Tosst\"&gt;Borok-Tosst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yi%20Niu\"&gt;Yi Niu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weimin%20Min\"&gt;Weimin Min&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ming-hua%20Dai\"&gt;Ming-hua Dai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yi%20Kwon\"&gt;Yi Kwon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jiang%20Dai\"&gt;Jiang Dai&lt;/a&gt; who merge\u00a0after clicking one of their sarcophagi, Ki Chin Sang will walk to you and hand over the key.\nAlternatively, the key can be pickpocketed (confirmed with Jan @ 125 skill). Your first try will get a few coins.\nUse the key to open the doors at (x=1350, y=550), disarm two traps to meet &lt;a href=\"Nan%20Kung%20Chi\"&gt;Nan Kung Chi&lt;/a&gt; at (x=2169, y=556), whatever you say will end up into a fight, loot his tomb at (x=2047, y=486). Once you possess the Claw of the Black Leopard, Hexxat will offer to be back to Amn, if you decide to stay a little longer (probably kill some ghosts for xp), just to tell her to wait then manual talk to her again. (Hexxat will have several lines for expressing her impatience to get back, but even after you\u2019ve got the Claw in your inventory that she\u2019s looking for, booting her won\u2019t make her take it, nor make her parting lines any different than usual...)\nShroud of the Unproved.\nAs before, the second message from L comes about one week later. Head to Graveyard after meeting Cabrina to get teleported, be sure to get prepared, as usual.\nWhen you arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Unproved\"&gt;Tomb of the Unproved&lt;/a&gt; (OH7200), you'll notice there are four Hakima with a ghostly appearance standing to the north-east. Learn their story if you like; their names are required later for a riddle (&lt;a href=\"Sukayna\"&gt;Sukayna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rabi%27ah\"&gt;Rabi'ah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilquis\"&gt;Bilquis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aminah\"&gt;Aminah&lt;/a&gt;). You can pass by them peacefully after the conversation or\u00a0prepare a difficult battle with them. Each is worth 10000xp and they drop a &lt;a href=\"Shortbow%20%2B3\"&gt;Shortbow +3&lt;/a&gt; and more than 10 greater healing potions (40 hp). They are two skilled Diviners and two Fighters. You can clear out the spiders and traps in the corridor south of the entrance before the battle if you need a place to retreat from their high-level spells (including &lt;a href=\"Time%20Stop\"&gt;Time Stop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gate\"&gt;Gate&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Abi-Dalzim%27s%20Horrid%20Wilting\"&gt;Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%2B1\"&gt;Scimitar +1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piece%20of%20Silk\"&gt;Piece of Silk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Statue\"&gt;Gold Statue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lamp%20of%20Oil\"&gt;Lamp of Oil&lt;/a&gt; from the chest behind them each\u00a0unlock more potential challenges later on.\nGo through the door south, disarm traps (x=450, y=1000) (x=450, y=1000) (x=450, y=1450) (x=450, y=1500) dealing with &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Spider\"&gt;Bloated Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. These are each of them pregnant with smaller spiders, which will burst out and attack when the Bloated Spiders die, unless the mother spiders are killed out of sight (e.g. with a well-aimed &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;).\u00a0\nPrior to passing through the next door, you can elect to put the Piece of Silk in the nearby statue container. It will disable three traps tied to the three other items found in the chest near the tomb's entrance. Taking back the Piece of Silk will not reactivate these traps, so read on to see what they do before making that decision.\nBehind the door is a hall of statues. If you didn't use the Piece of Silk, several things can happen:\nSeparate from the matter of the 4 special items, you can turn to flesh one of the eight green-circled mage statues; there is a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20to%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone to Flesh&lt;/a&gt; arcane scroll in the next room just in case. Upon killing them all, the dummy chest in this hall will \u201cdisappear\u201d so that you can loot it for &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Elvenkind\"&gt;Boots of Elvenkind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBugs.\nIn the library, Hexxat will initiate the dialog with &lt;a href=\"Diya%20al-Hafiz\"&gt;Diya al-Hafiz&lt;/a&gt; which will eventually wind up in\u00a0a fight, which means you can prepare traps &amp; summons before bringing Hexxat in there. Diya al-Hafiz, &lt;a href=\"Iqbal%20al-Din\"&gt;Iqbal al-Din&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Qais%20Ra%27id\"&gt;Qais Ra'id&lt;/a&gt; will also not move to other places if you closed the door ahead, and If Qais Ra'id is alive when other two are killed, he\u2019ll turn neutral and talk to you.\u00a0Keep in mind that the entire scene, including the HP of these three adversaries, may reset if you retreat and close the door. Most dialog options end up in killing Qais Ra'id, but if you tell him you\u2019ll come back to keep him company after you explore the temple, he\u2019ll remain neutral and follow the protagonist around (interestingly, or is it a bug?). The library has the following items:\nTake the Tale of the Prophet Unproved with you.\u00a0You won't be able to finish this dungeon\u00a0unless it's in your inventory.\nHead through the door (x=1800, y=950) to exit the library, walk the path on the empty squares:\nIf any X square is stepped upon, either a hostile Small Spider, Giant Spider, Sword Spider, or Phase Spider will be summoned. The traps will trigger ad infinitum.\nIn the room beyond is a chevron-shaped trap (x=750, y=1220), behind which lurks a Bloated Spider, plus a chatty, hand-hungry face over at (x=650, y=800). You can only solve this riddle if you brought along the Tale of the Prophet Unproved book from the library in your inventory. Activate the face to initiate dialogue, choose 1&gt;2&gt;1&gt;1&gt;any for the riddle, and the door (x=970, y=970) will open.\n&lt;a href=\"Raffiyah\"&gt;Raffiyah&lt;/a&gt;, who is borrowing &lt;a href=\"Centeol\"&gt;Centeol&lt;/a&gt;'s creature sprite, situation, and choices of pets and habitat, lies in there.\u00a0She\u00a0is quite open to flattery, and you can:\nWith the Shroud of the Unproved and no hostiles around, Hexxat will prompt you to leave, which you may postpone, as usual. Once back in Graveyard District, either leave her or accompany her over to the Copper Coronet to take the Casque and Shroud to Cabrina. Hexxat is now finally free to act on her own.\u00a0Her banters will continue, and so will her &lt;a href=\"romance\"&gt;romance&lt;/a&gt;, if your protagonist is female.\nThrone of Bhaal.\n There's a possible glitch which causes &lt;a href=\"Destroying%20the%20Order%20of%20Eight%20Staves\"&gt;Destroying the Order of Eight Staves&lt;/a&gt; to fail\n to trigger after this part of the quest. Do Neera's quest before Hexxat's to avoid the bug.\nWith Hexxat in your party, go to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zephir\"&gt;The Zephir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amkethran\"&gt;Amkethran&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Cabrina. She will inform you they have upgraded &lt;a href=\"Casque%20of%20Dragomir\"&gt;Casque of Dragomir&lt;/a&gt; with the previous items you acquired to create &lt;a href=\"Casque%20of%20Entrapment\"&gt;Casque of Entrapment&lt;/a&gt; and send you on a quest to regain a former servant of \"L\"'s, a Lich named &lt;a href=\"Korkorran\"&gt;Korkorran&lt;/a&gt;. You can tomb walk there right now or speak to Hexxat later to do so.\nAfter a few steps in the tomb you meet &lt;a href=\"Phreya\"&gt;Phreya&lt;/a&gt;, who will attack you no matter what you say, but disappears as she drops low in health. In the corridor to the left there is a hidden door that leads further into the tomb. Along your way you will encounter a few &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Mummy\"&gt;Greater Mummy&lt;/a&gt;s until you encounter Phreya for the second time. After a short talk she will fight you and then disappear again when her health is low.\nNext you meet a lady named &lt;a href=\"Umolex\"&gt;Umolex&lt;/a&gt; waiting for some fresh corpses. Annoyed that you are actually alive she will attack. She drops a &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20the%20Evil%20Archmagi\"&gt;Robe of the Evil Archmagi&lt;/a&gt;. A room later Phreya attacks you for the third time before vanishing again. The next rooms are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Golem\"&gt;Sand Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. The area that looks like the undisarmable spike trap from the last tomb doesn't seem to do anything than to look scary. The room behind it contains two &lt;a href=\"Beholder\"&gt;Beholder&lt;/a&gt;s and Phreya with the same procedure as every time. The door to the left leads to a dead end with &lt;a href=\"Culak\"&gt;Culak&lt;/a&gt; and his spider pets, giving you a &lt;a href=\"Edventar%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Ring of Free Action&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Girdle%20of%20Hill%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Girdle of Hill Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nA hidden door in the Beholder room gets you to the last quarter of this tomb. To open the locked door close the one you entered the responding room with. Behind it you will find a necrotic barrier that only hexxat may pass, so go ahead and split the party. Again, close the door behind you to open the next ones. The left room is a dead end for the moment as you can't open the next door within it. The right one only lets you proceed south and then west where you meet a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; named \"T'Lassus of the Bones\". It guardes a switch that deactivates the necrotic barriers, opens all of the linked doors and links the locked doors of the right and left room to the doors you enter these rooms with. Both lead to Phreya and Korkorran. This time you can kill Phreya as well as the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Topsider%27s%20Crutch\"&gt;Ring of Infravision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Worn%20Whispers\"&gt;Boots of Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. But something isn't right. If you haven't read the unique books of this tomb yet, you should read them now. Proceed and you will find the real Korkorran. Be nice to him and you get more interesting dialogue about Hexxat. Hexxat can ask Korkorran to make her human again, which he does. After Hexxat becomes human she ages 237 years then dies and cannot be resurrected. Either way, now kill him. Once finished \"L\" will appear in the form of\u00a0the resurrected Lich's corpse to address Hexxat. He says he will honour the agreement and that Cabrina will be in touch.\nThe next time you rest Cabrina will appear with \"L\" in the form of Korkorran. It is revealed that the deal stuck between Hexxat and \"L\" (who we learn is Larloch) is for Hexxat to become mortal. If this happens she will die permanently as her mortal years rush to meet her. It may seem there is simply no convincing her not to go through with this deal but if you allow her to have her say, and then agree to kill her if she asks, she will stay a vampire for you and remain in the party. \u200b\u200b\u200bInterestingly there are several options requesting her to make you a vampire, but they all lead to Hexxat\u00a0stating\"\u00a0\"I cannot give you what you desire. If I made it seem otherwise - well, I'm good at making it seem otherwise. But I'm done using you\"\". - possibly indicating that allowing the player to become a\u00a0vampire was in development but scrapped."}

If you enter the Jae'llat Home all inhabitants will be hostile, knowing that their warded door has been breached. A battle for survival will ensue. Expect no quarter. She is on the lower platform along with &lt;a href=\"Ist%27tar%20Jae%27llat\"&gt;Ist'tar Jae'llat&lt;/a&gt; and several female &lt;a href=\"Jae%27llat%20Guard\"&gt;Jae'llat Guard&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\nGameplay.\nHindra begins the scenario on the lower platform. Her opening self preparatory buffs (which cannot be interrupted) include &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20One\"&gt;Strength of One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Harmony\"&gt;Defensive Harmony&lt;/a&gt;. Note that these allied friendly AoE spells will also buff her nearby guard companions (of which there are 6 on the platform with her).\nHindra may also cast &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Cloak of Fear&lt;/a&gt; on herself.\nWhen she detects a party member, she has several options to attack with divine magic, including &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Bolt of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;Slay Living&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miscast%20Magic\"&gt;Miscast Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dolorous%20Decay\"&gt;Dolorous Decay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mental%20Domination\"&gt;Mental Domination&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nShe will likely cast &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; if any party members are invisible, and she will cast &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Cure\"&gt;Mass Cure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Healing\"&gt;Mass Healing&lt;/a&gt; if herself or allies are damaged to a certain threshold. She will attempt a &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; on self if reduced to 10% of her original HP.\nHindra may also summon assistance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Animate%20Dead\"&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nIf pressed into close quarters combat, she will resist with her relatively good armor class and &lt;a href=\"Drow%20Flail\"&gt;Drow Flail&lt;/a&gt;. Many hostile spells may fail against her, as she has very high magic resistance.\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod makes a few changes to this creature. Her weapon proficiencies are corrected to 1 pip in flail and 1 pip in single weapon style. The Wizard Spell version of &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Fear%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Symbol, Fear (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; is removed. A complete compliment of divine spells is memorized from levels 1 through 7. Some of the spells are different than the unmodded creature. A default SCS cleric AI script is installed for \"Smarter Cleric\" behavior. An SCS random treasure is in the creature's inventory as well. Hindra will now aggressively cast as many spells as possible unless disrupted or killed. She will heal herself, cast True Seeing and self-buffs, and summon creatures.\nWith SCS Hindra will launch a group of preparatory protections (cast previously) including: &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20Faith\"&gt;Armor of Faith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Mirror\"&gt;Physical Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Free Action (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Commands\"&gt;Chaotic Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom this point on, further clerical spell casting choices are driven by the AI's threat assessment and party vulnerability evaluations. Various offensive spells such as &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Blight\"&gt;Unholy Blight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slay%20Living\"&gt;Slay Living&lt;/a&gt; are valid options. Various disabling spells such as &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mental%20Domination\"&gt;Mental Domination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silence%2C%2015%27%20Radius\"&gt;Silence, 15' Radius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Symbol%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Symbol, Stun&lt;/a&gt; are in play.\nShe will use &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; on self if she meets certain conditions, as well as &lt;a href=\"heal\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; if original HP are reduced to 60% (can be done twice). She also will attempt to remove hostile clouds with &lt;a href=\"Zone%20of%20Sweet%20Air\"&gt;Zone of Sweet Air&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Healing\"&gt;Mass Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Harmony\"&gt;Defensive Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Fear\"&gt;Remove Fear&lt;/a&gt; and other buffs will be used to support allied companions.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod is installed, the drow's memorized spells will be the SR versions.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod, a \"Perfect Clay Golem\" is placed in bodyguard position adjacent to Hindra. This golem is tougher than a usual &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Golem\"&gt;Clay Golem&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "13087", "revid": "49135869", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13087", "title": "Hit Dice", "text": "Hit Dice, or Hit Die /\u00a0HD, are\u00a0mentioned in class kit descriptions as well as in some spells.\nFor non-player creatures, HD is roughly synonymous with character level, with higher HD often representing stronger and tougher creatures.\nFor playable characters, it\u2019s one of the defining factors in their total &lt;a href=\"Hit%20point\"&gt;Hit Points&lt;/a&gt; (HP). Each class has a set dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) which is rolled each time the class levels up to determine the total HP gained at that level. The character's &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; will also affect their HP.\nWhen starting a character at Level 1, the character will always roll the maximum starting HP. The Enhanced Editions have a gameplay option (Max HP On Level Up) which automatically adds the maximum roll\u00a0possible at each level up.\nSingle Class HP.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;Rogues&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Class%20group\"&gt;Wizards&lt;/a&gt;\nConstitution modifiers to HP are capped at +2 per level for all classes except Warrior-types (including Barbarians), so a Constitution value of over 16 does not really benefit a Priest, Rogue or Wizard type.\nMulti-Class HP.\nWhen a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Multi-class\"&gt;Multi-Class&lt;/a&gt; character levels up, the rolled Hit Dice is divided by 2 (for double-classes) or 3 (for triple-classes). In the case of a decimal value, the result is always rounded down EXCEPT for values less than 1, in which case it is rounded up. For example, 1.666 rounds down to 1; 0.333 rounds up to 1.\nFor example, a level 1/1/1\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Cleric&lt;/a&gt; with 10 &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; (no bonuses or penalties) has 7\u00a0HP (10 from Fighter+4 from Mage+8 from Cleric)/3=22/3=7.333=7 after rounding down).\nWhen a character has a Constitution bonus (or penalty), this is also divided by the number of classes the character has.\u00a0 If the multi-class has a Fighter, the Warrior Constitution bonus is applied. However, unlike the normal Hit Dice roll, the Constitution bonus is calculated based on the total sum of class levels that the character has.\nFor example, a level 1/1/1\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Cleric\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Cleric&lt;/a&gt; with 18 &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(+4 HP/level bonus, since the character is part Fighter) starts with 7 HP from the normal Hit Dice roll. The additional HP from CON is calculated by (CON Bonus \u00f7 Number of Classes x Total Class Level). This calculates to (4 \u00f7 3 x 3) = 4, for a total starting HP of 11.\nAs another example, a level 7/7/7 &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20/%20Mage%20/%20Thief\"&gt;Fighter / Mage / Thief&lt;/a&gt; with 10 &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; (no bonuses or penalties) has 42 HP. If the character drinks a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Potion of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, raising their CON to 18, the additional HP gain is calculated by (4 \u00f7 3 x 21) = 28, resulting in a total HP of 70 for the duration of the potion.\nDual-class HP.\n&lt;a href=\"Classes%23Dual-class\"&gt;Dual-Class&lt;/a&gt; characters will stop gaining HP once the dual begins until they reactive their first class, then they gain HP each level as the second class normally would.\nFor example, a &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Slayer\"&gt;Wizard Slayer&lt;/a&gt; with 15 Constitution will gain 1d10 + 1 HP per level up. If they Dual-Class to &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; at level 7, then they will gain no HP for Mage levels 1-7. When leveling up to Mage level 8, they will gain 1d4 + 1 HP, and once they reach level 11, they will start gaining a fixed + 1 HP per level as a Mage would.\nCharacters who dual-class into &lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt; do only get additional bonus HP for &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; over 16 for those levels which they leveled as Fighters only. For example, a Thief who duals to Fighter at level 7 will only get max. +2 HP bonus per level from constitution for levels 1-7 but can get higher bonus HP (e.g. +4 per level with 18 constitution) for levels 8 and 9, after which constitution bonus ends anyway.\nMages keep their familiar from &lt;a href=\"Find%20Familiar\"&gt;Find Familiar&lt;/a&gt; and its HP bonus, even while their mage class is inactive, if they have already summoned the familiar.\nAverage Hitpoints by Class.\nThere is randomness in how many hitpoints are gained on level-up.\nIn practice, the game engine appears to take the best of 2 dice rolls (tested with a fighter d10 in EE 2.6.6.0).\nThe following table shows average hitpoints for each class.\nThe average HP gain on level up in a multi-class is a little less than expected because of rounding down. See Multi-Class HP section above.\nAverage hitpoints for multi-classes are shown below.\nAchievements.\nJuggernaut BG1.\nReach 150 Hit Points during or .\nJuggernaut BG2.\nReach 150 Hit Points during ."}
{"id": "41614", "revid": "53053884", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41614", "title": "Hit point", "text": "A Hit Point, also shown as \"Hit Points\" and abbreviated as HP - is a numerical value assigned to all creatures in the \"Baldur's Gate\" franchise that determines how much \"health\" they have (or life force), and thusly how much damage they can accumulate before they die. A Hit Point modifier or value are categorized as either \"Maximum\" hit points or \"Current\" hit points.\nMaximum hit points are the total number hit points a creature is permitted to have when fully healthy, and is based upon their experience level, class, and other factors. Whilst certain effects can temporarily boost this value, the only true way to increase this value is by leveling up.\nCurrent hit points, in comparison, denotes how many hit points out of their maximum hit point value a creature has at the present moment. This decreases as they take damage and increases as they receive healing. Some spells or items can boost or decrease a creature's current HP, and some of these will only have a temporary duration.\nCertain spells can only apply if the characters current hit points are below a certain maximum. For example, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt; only works if the target's current HP are below 90. Maximum HP doesn't matter here, only the current HP, so a creature with higher HP can be &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;d until it is below the threshold and then the spell can apply.\nThe quantity of hit points that a creature receives is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Dice\"&gt;Hit Dice&lt;/a&gt; mechanic. It is also affected by the &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;ability score&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a creature's HP goes down to 0 or below, it dies. If this happens to the main character, the game is over. Companions can be revived by spells or temples, except if they are brought to -10 HP or lower by the final hit (\"chunked\"), at which point they become permanently dead and are removed from the party forever.\nCertain enemies, like &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s, can only be killed with certain &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; types; otherwise, if they go down to 1 HP, they fall unconscious but won't die, and slowly regenerate back up.\nMethods to increase Hit Points.\nIn addition to leveling up and getting more hit dice, HP can also be increased in other ways:\nTemporary increases:.\nAdditionally, increases to the constitution &lt;a href=\"Ability%20Scores\"&gt;Ability score&lt;/a&gt; can potentially raise hit points, depending on the attribute increase and the character's class. HP increases through constitution increases can be permanent or temporary, depending on the source. For example, a temporary increase can be achieved through a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Potion of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;, spells and abilities like &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Upon%20Holy%20Might\"&gt;Draw Upon Holy Might&lt;/a&gt;, or equipment like &lt;a href=\"Buckley%27s%20Buckler\"&gt;Buckley's Buckler&lt;/a&gt;, and a permanent increase can be achieved through a &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Bodily%20Health\"&gt;Manual of Bodily Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constitution%23Constitution%20score%20altering\"&gt;other means&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee the chart on the &lt;a href=\"Constitution\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; article for specific HP changes and bonuses derived from constitution scores and character class."}

It liberally fires any of the eye rays shown in the InfoBox, under the triggers/conditions shown.\nSpell casting is also performed mostly in-between eye ray firing, as scripted by target detection and type. \nThe Hive Mother will notice when its eye rays are bouncing back at itself, and cease using \"certain\" rays at that protected creature, such if they were protected with the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Balduran\"&gt;Shield of Balduran&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs these attacks are scripted, it does not actually run out of these eye beams or spells through use, the only limitation on them is a timed delay interval between applied uses at detected targets. None of the eye beams or spells can be interrupted via damage.\nThe Hive Mother will cast a spell or fire an eye beam at a target, at least once every round.\nWhen an enemy is detected, the creature will apply a contingency that protects the creature with a &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mantle\"&gt;Improved Mantle&lt;/a&gt;. Another contingency will be applied when the creature's stoneskin is depleted.\nSummoned creatures are recognized, as well as undead creatures, with different eye rays and spells designated for them.\nIf required, the beholder can launch a regular wizard &lt;a href=\"Death%20Spell\"&gt;Death Spell&lt;/a&gt; in the area to destroy detected summoned creatures, but just once.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod and the \"Tactical Challengers for BG2\" component will add a Hive Mother to the &lt;a href=\"Beholder%20Cave%20in%20Underdark\"&gt;Beholder Cave in Underdark&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other gauths and or Death Tyrants and standard Beholders, depending on the game difficulty level you have selected.\nWith this mod, beholders are given different colored animations to distinguish between normal beholders, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Tyrant\"&gt;Death Tyrant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Orb\"&gt;Elder Orb&lt;/a&gt; and Hive Mother varieties.\nWith this mod, the creature has a level 20 Mage class assigned and 200 HP.

Unlike the unmodified creature, when all the spells are cast, they are expended.\nSCS Hive Mother Beholders have been provided with a more potent Anti-Magic Ray (SPIN550.SPL), that drains spells from memory and charges from items and wands in quick slots or if equipped. \nThe Hive Mother's rapid firing Cause Serious Wounds ray (SPIN551.SPL) now bypasses magic resistance and deals 5d8 Magic energy damage and has &lt;a href=\"power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; 0 so it will ignore spell level protections such as Spell Trap and Spell Deflection. \nThe Hive Mother has a super potent Disintegration eyestalk (SPIN552.SPL), that has a -4 penalty to saving throws. If you are playing SCS with &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt;, the disintegrate beam also deals massive magic energy damage (35d6), even if you make your saving throw, you'll take at least 5d6. The Hive Mother's telekinesis eyestalk will steal the Shield of Balduran and or the Cloak of Mirroring from an opponent in range, after a few rounds.\nIn addition to the abilities, immunities and special powers of the unmodded variety. the SCS Hive Mother is innately protected from its own beholder blasts, in case they were reflected.\nSCS also includes a permanent &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Alacrity\"&gt;Improved Alacrity&lt;/a&gt; to the creature, so that there is no spell launch/beholder beam \"cool down\" period between attacks. The Beholder is able to cast a spell and at least two beams every round of combat. Sometimes it will be a spell cast and three beholder beams per round. \nThe SCS Hive Mother version's Anti-magic ray will take down a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magic\"&gt;Protection From Magic&lt;/a&gt; scroll's protection and get rid of it.

Such labels may be found in an affected character's \"Record\" screen, in-game combat logs, or simply spell, item or ability descriptions.\nTypically, we could expect that a \"held\" affecting a party member should refer to the Hold creature effect, and \"paralyzed\" to the Paralyze effect, but don't bet your house on it.\nIf unsure, take a look at this page's infobox. It only contains sources that really do inflict the Hold creature 2 effect.\nTrivia.\nPrevious versions of IESDP titled the &lt;a href=\"Opcode\"&gt;Opcode&lt;/a&gt; 185 effect code as STATE: Hold Creature III. The Hold effect states were at one time 109 STATE: Hold Creature I, and 175 was STATE: Hold Creature II.\nMod content.\nThe upcoming release of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/eefp/\"&gt;Enhanced Edition Fix Pack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt; has already beta coded a large overhaul pertaining to Hold Creature 2, as follows:\nRevamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web \nIn the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes).\nAs the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. \nEEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect."}

Gorion didn't bring you up half bad, did he? You're lucky to have grown up here in Candlekeep, to be honest. Sometimes I think that the world outside these gates has gone mad, what with all this fighting over iron shortages and all. Amn and Baldur's Gate will be at war before the season's out, mark my words... Anyhow, I'm on duty. Here's 20 gold pieces for saving my skin from the Chief.\"\nReaction \u2264 14\n\"Took your sweet time, didn't you? Gorion's a fool for trying to bring you up right and you can tell him I said so, too. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this whole iron crisis is the result of twerps like you wandering off with people's swords. Here's 10 gold pieces. Now get out of here, I'm on duty.\"\nIf you speak to Hull without the sword:\n\"Don't make me beg, kid! Now get my sword before the Gatewarden has my hide!\"\nAny further conversation attempt:\n\"'Ssh, kid. I'm on duty.\"\"\nChapter Six.\n\"Now there's a face I never thought I'd see again in a million years. When we heard about Gorion's passing, Fuller and I went out to gather his body but you were nowhere to be seen. I don't know what you two came across that night but Gorion died a noble death saving you from it.\"\nAny further conversation attempt:\n\"Yeah, I'm on duty right now but maybe we can share a few drinks when my shift's over.\""}

A lot of this project is based upon the work of the IWD-in-BG2 conversion project, which later formed the backbone of IWDEE. The mod adds various elements such as selectable bard songs, two-handed axes, and over 70 new spells into your BG2, Tutu, BGT, BGEE, BG2EE, or EET game.\nMain components.\nIWDification has several components, which can be installed completely independently of one another. The components are broken into three broad categories:\nKnown mod conflicts/issues.\nIWD Class Updates: Bard: Add IWD Bard Songs should be installed after the &lt;a href=\"Rogue%20Rebalancing\"&gt;Rogue Rebalancing&lt;/a&gt; and Garrick: Tales of a Troubadour mods. Note that IWDification's new bard songs will replace Rogue Rebalacing's normal trueclass bard song, but it will not affect the kitted bard songs and will preserve the HLA bard songs--e.g. a trueclass bard will get IWDification's bard songs, but they will get RR's version of the Enhanced Bard Song as an HLA selection. Kitted bards will just get Rogue Reblancing's songs.\nIWDification should be installed before argent77's &lt;a href=\"Trials%20of%20the%20Luremaster\"&gt;Trials of the Luremaster&lt;/a&gt; for Baldur's Gate mod.\nKnown Issues\nTwo-handed axes use the same combat and paperdoll animations as halberds.\nContact Other Plane has no dialogue written, and is therefore unavailable at present.\nKnown Issues (Non-EE Games)\nFor the Arcane and Divine Spell Packs, not all spells could be converted to the original Baldur's Gate II engine. The Cat's Grace spell (part of the Arcane Spell Pack) requires TobEx for its unique dexterity modifications. Giant Insect (part of the Divine Spell Pack) requires the beetle animation, part of Infinity Animations. Soul Eater, Seven Eyes, Favor of Ilmater, and Spiritual Wrath are not available. All of the compromises made for the Arcane or Divine Spell Packs can be found in the notes on their respective spell listings (arcane, divine).\nIf you install the Arcane Spell Pack, Divine Spell Pack, or Add IWD Bard Songs after Expanded Portrait Icons, they can roll back some of the changes from Expanded Portrait Icons. Given that Expanded Portrait Icons is the last component of the mod, this should only be a concern if you're running the installer multiple times.\nInstallation.\nThe mods \"read me\" has advice and instructions as well as helpful links, including Windows, MacOS and Linux users.

See the InfoBox for a listing.\nThere is the special &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem%20%28Guardian%20of%20Ice%29\"&gt;Ice Golem (Guardian of Ice)&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Watcher%27s%20Keep%20Elemental%20Level\"&gt;Watcher's Keep Elemental Level&lt;/a&gt;, which requires +3 weapons to hit.\nWhen the golem is hit by any sort of fire damage, the golem produces a &lt;a href=\"Scalding%20Steam\"&gt;Scalding Steam&lt;/a&gt; effect, which is implemented as an innate spell.\nThis spell manifests as a \"White Fireball\" animation centered on the golem, that explodes in a 15' diameter in all directions. Any creatures in the area of effect are potentially exposed to the \"steam\", which can inflict 10d3 &lt;a href=\"Cold%20damage\"&gt;Cold damage&lt;/a&gt;. A saving throw vs. breath will negate, and a &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; will block it, and so can &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scalding Steam can occur over and over, anytime the golem is hit by fire damage.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod adds a droppable item when the golem is defeated. It is a shard of special ice that can be used as a necessary component when the party mage attempts to build their own Ice Golem.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod and the installation of the \"AI Enhancements\" component improves many aspects of creatures encountered in the game. In regard to golems, the mod implements the following:\nImproved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT/EET)&lt;br&gt;\nThis component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a sensible range, makes them immune to \"Lower Resistance\" and to poison, and tries to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind barricades.\nIce golems are immune to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Resistance\"&gt;Lower Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Magic\"&gt;Pierce Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;Pierce Shield&lt;/a&gt; spells.&lt;br&gt;\nIf you damage an SCS golem, and then decide to back away and rest somewhere, to continue the fight later, the golem will be restored to full health.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Ice golem gets a revised AI script to change their targeting behavior slightly. In addition to the Scalding Steam ability, the Ice Golem also is able to unleash a &lt;a href=\"Cone%20of%20Cold\"&gt;Cone of Cold&lt;/a&gt;, about every three rounds of combat, as long as an enemy is within 10 feet of the golem.

The gate connecting to the Ice Library will still locked until the party possesses the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Scepter\"&gt;Ice Scepter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the party enters the Ice Laboratory the guardian and ice mists will attack.

This can be done again on a timed basis, over and over, depending on how long the creature is viable.\nThe guardian and mists will attempt to close to melee range and attack the nearest enemy they can find.\nIf the party has not performed the actions described in the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Library%20Note\"&gt;Slime Library Note&lt;/a&gt;, they will quickly find out that the creatures in the ice laboratory are immune to all attempts to damage or harm them by the party.\nThe Ice chamber itself gives an advantage to the ice creatures within, as the bone chilling temperatures will apply a transient &lt;a href=\"Slow%20effect\"&gt;Slow effect&lt;/a&gt; upon any party members who venture within. Like any slow effect, this can be countered with &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Free%20Action\"&gt;Free Action&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrying to draw these creatures out of the Ice Laboratory will prove difficult, as they will only move so far from their protective chamber before moving back inside.\nIn order to actually destroy these creatures, the Ice Laboratory chamber must be flooded with the toxic vapors produced in the Slime Laboratory, as described in the Slime Library Note. This action requires opening connecting gates and activating the magical fan to maximum - basically blowing air from the fan chamber, into the Slime laboratory, through the Slime Library and into the Ice Laboratory. Only then, when a party member enters the Ice lab will a poison cloud appear and render the ice creatures vulnerable to attacks.\nThe Guardian of Ice can only be hit by weapons of at least +3 enchantment (including &lt;a href=\"The%20Kneecapper\"&gt;The Kneecapper&lt;/a&gt;, which has normally +1 but +4 against golems). \nRecover the Ice Scepter from the dead Ice Golem guardian. This scepter allows the opening of the Ice lab's connecting gate to the Ice Library."}

He wants the party to &lt;a href=\"retrieve%20Shandalar%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;retrieve&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Shandalar%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 either by agreeing to help him voluntarily with this &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; or by forcing them to undertake it.\nThe location and exact nature of the island are unknown, although some people theorize that it is a type of teleportation prison.\nThe log, however states another direction: \"You have been teleported by Shandalar, far up to the north, on an island lost within the ice floes of the northern ocean.\"\nThe island has two levels: the surface and an underground dungeon. On the surface a &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Bear\"&gt;Polar Bear&lt;/a&gt; is strolling around, while a second one is encountered inside the dungeon. Also in the dungeon are several &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Wolf\"&gt;Winter Wolves&lt;/a&gt; along with seven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. One of the mages, all of whom are trapped on the island, will be in possession of the cloak.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen entering the maze in the southeast of the map, two Winter Wolves will attack the party, with the second one waiting around the corner.\nIn the first bigger hall, a group of mages awaits: the \"island greeter\" &lt;a href=\"Andris\"&gt;Andris&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Beyn\"&gt;Beyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marcellus\"&gt;Marcellus&lt;/a&gt;. No matter how Gorion's Ward negotiates \u2013 a fight ensues. The &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Normal%20Missiles\"&gt;from normal missiles protected&lt;/a&gt; Andris will first use a &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20Door\"&gt;Dimension Door&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;shielded&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and thus immune against spells from &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;level 1 to 3&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Beyn &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;steps aside&lt;/a&gt; for a moment. For more information about their specific spell casting abilities, see their individual character pages.\nFrom here, three pathways lead off deeper into the maze. Either follow the long and complete path, or &lt;a href=\"%23short\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; to the one that directly leads to the person and the item you came here looking for.\nWhen following the left of the two northeastern paths, after disabling a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Strike\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; at its entrance, in the next big hall another Winter Wolf is encountered \u2013 with the mage &lt;a href=\"Cuchol\"&gt;Cuchol&lt;/a&gt; in sight, who will initiate dialogue before eventual combat ensues. He's an opponent very similar to Beyn, including the spell immunity.\nThe path to the southeast, out of this hall, is &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missile\"&gt;trapped&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the long hall directly west to the first one with the three mages, &lt;a href=\"Garan\"&gt;Garan&lt;/a&gt; questions the party. After losing his patience, he will summon his four &lt;a href=\"Ankheg\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving the battlefield for a short time through a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Door\"&gt;Shadow Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeaving that hall to the west leads through a narrow and contorted path, with a Polar Bear at a southwestern expansion \u2013 and a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; on the floor behind it before ending in a dead end alley. Traveling east, two more Winter Wolves are encountered in the recess near the entrance hall.\nThe right of the two northeastern paths out of the entrance hall is &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Missiles\"&gt;trapped&lt;/a&gt; though this one is located a couple of feet away from its beginning. Further down the way, two more traps are set: the first &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; around halfway up of the northernmost section, and the second &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; right around the following corner \u2013 nearly in eyeshot of the next mage.\n&lt;a href=\"Tellan\"&gt;Tellan&lt;/a&gt; is the only one here with whom a fight can be avoided \u2013 by making an offer to take him with you, while asking for his assistance. The latter, however, won't be given \u2013 he just follows your way, or gets in it, and in the end you only can leave him down here. He too is protected from normal missiles.\nAround the corner behind Tellan, the path leads into a more open area, with three more Winter Wolves to the left and \u2013 just out of sight to the right is the last actor in this play; the one who's left; the one who has to be the bearer of the cloak you're looking for \u2013 who, if not he? &lt;a href=\"Dezkiel\"&gt;Dezkiel&lt;/a&gt; is the most talkative of the mages in the dungeon; the one with the most insights and philosophical thoughts. But all that won't keep him from attacking you in the end. Beware his immunity to spells of level 1 to 3.\nAfter taking Shandalar's cloak from Dezkiel's body, together with some &lt;a href=\"Dezkiel%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;sort of journal&lt;/a&gt;, the door behind him leads back to the island's entry point \u2013 more weird and twisted magic in this place. It won't take long, and Shandalar's callback spell becomes effective automatically, now that the &lt;a href=\"Shandalar%27s%20Wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; and cloak are reunited in the open \u2013 the party gets teleported back to Ulgoth's Beard."}

{"id": "51559", "revid": "46775035", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51559", "title": "Power level", "text": "In \"Baldur's Gate 1\" and \"2\", spells, innate abilities, item abilities, traps, on-hit effects from weapon and ammunition, consumables, and more, act on their target(s) through a series of \"effects\". Each effect has an associated power level, a number between 0 and 9. Though not introduced in game interfaces and manuals, power level is used in combat to determine whether an effect can pass through certain defenses.\nDescription.\nPower level is a characteristic that all effects have, and a number of defensive effects rely on it for two tasks:\nThese defensive effects are \"Immunity to power level\" (used by e.g. &lt;a href=\"Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;), \"Power level deflection\" (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt;), \"Power level turning\" (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;), \"Power level trap\" (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Spell type deflection\" (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Shield\"&gt;Spell Shield&lt;/a&gt;). \"Immunity to power level\" only cares about the first task, \"Spell type deflection\" only cares about the second, and the other three care about both.\nAs far as the first task is concerned, all four relevant defensive effects are configured to target a specific power level \u2014 when they target level 3, they will entirely ignore effects with power level 0-2 and 4-9. So a spell aiming to give protection from low level effects will typically contain several copies of the protective effect, one targeting power level 1, another power level 2 and so on.\nThe second task is more of a countdown: The defensive effect starts at a certain value, for example 12, and decreases it by the power level of the effect that was blocked. When reaching zero or less, the defensive effect is removed after the effect is blocked. Finally, when several effects hit the defense over a short time period, only the first one is counted. This behavior seems similar to &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpell level vs power level.\nWhen it comes to spells, the power level of each effect contained within is very often the same as the \"spell level\", the value frequently advertised in game interfaces. So a player can expect that all effects within the &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball spell&lt;/a&gt;, which has spell level 3, will have power level 3. But it isn't always true. For example when &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt; is said to shield from spell level 1, 2 and 3, what it really does is shield from effects with \"power level\" 1, 2 and 3. If both &lt;a href=\"Remove%20Magic\"&gt;Remove Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, two level 3 spells, can bypass the Minor Globe, it is because their effects have respectively power level 0 and 4.\nSpell level has no bearing in combat, it is only used for spell learning and memorization concerns.\nIn the wiki and elsewhere, the distinction is not made explicitly; the reader has to understand from context whether \"level\" means spell, power, or the caster's level. There is also some confusion around the web, where the words \"spell level\" are routinely used when talking about power level. As for in-game descriptions and manuals, they don't introduce it at all, preferring to either talk about spell level or stay silent.\nUsage in combat.\nThe five defensive effects are found in the following spells and items:\nThey are also used to grant the innate characteristics of some enemies. A &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Golem\"&gt;Bone Golem&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Demilich%20%28Watcher%27s%20Keep%29\"&gt;Demilich&lt;/a&gt;, for example, are immune to level 1-9 effects because they benefit from nine \"Immunity to power level\" effects.\nIt should be noted that no defense in the game blocks effects for being level 0. So when an attack contains a level 0 effect, that effect can only be blocked if either the attack or the effect itself can be grabbed from an angle other than power level. For example it could be through the spell type \"&lt;a href=\"Offensive%20damage%20type\"&gt;Offensive damage&lt;/a&gt;\" thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Mirroring\"&gt;Cloak of Mirroring&lt;/a&gt;, through the spell school thanks to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, through weapon immunity thanks to &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, through damage type immunity thanks to &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Fire%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Protection From Fire&lt;/a&gt;, or through explicit immunity to the status effect, thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Level%20drain\"&gt;Level drain&lt;/a&gt; for instance.\nFinding level 0 effects.\nHaving a sense of just what is likely to include power level 0 effects can help in combat. That level is largely used to configure effects that aren't supposed to be magical, like those from abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Attack\"&gt;Whirlwind Attack&lt;/a&gt; or from elemental attacks that can be considered natural such as a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Explosions\"&gt;Potion of Explosions&lt;/a&gt;. But effects that may conceptually be seen as magical are still made level 0 in a number of cases:\nTo confirm whether an effect within an attack is level 0, one way could be to use it against a character protected only by Globe of Invulnerability. If any effect in the attack has power level in 1-4, it should be blocked even if it's a weapon's on-hit effect, and the combat log should display \"Spell ineffective\". If nothing appears and there's no reason to think power level would be in 5-9, then it is likely level 0.\nBut hidden as they are, the best way to search the game for good power level candidates is to use a tool such as &lt;a href=\"Near%20Infinity\"&gt;Near Infinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeveraging power level.\nIn a general sense, a good understanding of power level and other hidden mechanics helps to think up creative approaches that free up spell slots, reduce resource consumption, suggest better equipment selection and better strategy, and generally give an easier time roaming the land.\nHere's a couple suggestions:\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack&lt;/a&gt; makes several changes to item Power levels. Some of them may end up being ported by &lt;a href=\"Beamdog\"&gt;Beamdog&lt;/a&gt; to the hypothetical version 2.7 of &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Edition\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt;s. In particular, weapons from various have had their effects switched to level 0, such as &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Blades%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Energy Blades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Blade\"&gt;Flame Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seeds\"&gt;Fire Seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20Touch\"&gt;Ghoul Touch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt;. The heal from &lt;a href=\"Goodberry\"&gt;Goodberries&lt;/a&gt; received the same treatment."}

This includes &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s,\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0of any level.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s may also cast priest spells, but only once they have reached a high enough level.\nFor general information on casting magic, see &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;Spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nLearning Spells.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"wizard%20spells\"&gt;wizard spells&lt;/a&gt;, priest spells are not scribed from scrolls. Instead, spells of each level are automatically learned when that level becomes accessible. For example, a level 1 cleric automatically knows all 1st level spells that they qualify for; when they reach level 3, they will automatically learn all 2nd level spells that they qualify for, and so on. The shaman class is the only exception, as they must choose which spells they learn (similar to the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;).\nPaladins only reach 4th level spells; rangers only reach 3rd level spells. In addition, their caster level is adjusted based on the level that they gain access to spellcasting. See their class pages for more information.\nCertain priest spells are only available to clerics (and paladins), and some are only available to druids (and shamans and rangers). The &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Ranger\"&gt;Cleric / Ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"multi-class\"&gt;multi-class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dual-class\"&gt;dual-class&lt;/a&gt; has access to both lists for 1st - 3rd levels, and depending on the game version, may have access to 4th - 7th levels as well.\nSpell Slots and Casting Restrictions.\nClerics and druids gain additional spell slots based on their &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; score. These are gained as soon as the level is available; for example, a level 1 cleric with 18 WIS will have three 1st level spell slots available.\nShamans, paladins, and rangers do not gain additional spell slots.\nIn the original \"&lt;a href=\"Baldur%27s%20Gate%20%28game%29\"&gt;Baldur's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt;\", characters must have 17 WIS to cast 6th level priest spells and 18 WIS to cast 7th level priest spells. This requirement was removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;\", and is not present in the Enhanced Editions.\nEquipment that increases priest spell slots:\nDue\u00a0to the different level caps in the games, certain priests may have access to spell levels that other priests don't. See the table below for the maximum spell level attainable by each class at each level cap.\nSchools.\nPriest spells have schools; these\u00a0interact with &lt;a href=\"Specialist%20Mage\"&gt;Specialist Mage&lt;/a&gt; bonuses for &lt;a href=\"saving%20throw\"&gt;saving throw&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, an Invoker &gt; Cleric dual-class will apply a -2 save penalty when enemies save vs. &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Barrier\"&gt;Blade Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, since it is an evocation spell; Enchanters will receive a +2 save bonus vs. &lt;a href=\"Charm%20Person%20or%20Mammal\"&gt;Charm Person or Mammal&lt;/a&gt; cast by a druid, since it is an enchantment/charm spell.\nThe schools do not interact with specialist restrictions; for example, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Illusionist&lt;/a&gt; can still cast all necromancy priest spells, even though they cannot cast necromancy wizard spells.\nPriest spells also have spheres, but these have no mechanical interactions.\nScrolls.\nCertain priest spells are available as scrolls. Their only use is as quick items to be cast, however.\u00a0 All priest scrolls can be cast by any of the normal priest spell classes, plus the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; scrolls are unique and may be cast by any class. As with wizard scrolls, they require 9 &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to use.\nQuest Spells.\nStarting at 3,000,000 XP in \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20of%20Amn\"&gt;Shadows of Amn&lt;/a&gt;\" (only accessible in with \"&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Bhaal\"&gt;Throne of Bhaal&lt;/a&gt;\" installed or in \"\"), priests gain access to &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;high-level class abilities&lt;/a&gt; referred to as Quest Spells. These represent exceptional divine powers granted to the priest by their deity. These are only available if the priest has gained 7th level spell slots, and the priest has the ability to select one at each level up. These are added to their priest scroll as 7th level spells, and otherwise function exactly as other spells do.\nSpell List.\nThe following abbreviations are used in the table below:"}

These include &lt;a href=\"Death%20Ward\"&gt;Death Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bless\"&gt;Bless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20One\"&gt;Strength of One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Harmony\"&gt;Defensive Harmony&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnless the party is inept or extremely unlucky, then she will probably already be defeated within a round of this action, and unable to complete another spell cast attempt. But if not, then she will methodically attempt further divine spell casting at valid targets. It is improbable that any of those attempts will succeed at this stage of the game.\nClerics of Umberlee are not typically classified as innocents. Killing her may be grisly and unnecessary but leads to no reputation penalty. It will shutter this temple for further use.\nMod content.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; mod revises the cleric with a changed opening battery of defensive buffs.

As with the unmodified game, the priestess will probably be dead in a round or two and disrupted from further spell casting success from a party at this game stage. If for some strange reason she is not defeated and is able to complete her high-level divine spells casts, then the party could be in some level of risk."}

Instead of being feebleminded, it can cause insanity, and rather than disintegration, a victim is sent to another plane. The Pen and Paper spell has 70x15 feet spray effect. But the largest difference is that anyone in the spray can be affected, there is no immunity for the caster and allies.\nMod content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its Spell School, casting time, saving throw, effects, and description.

These include all colors of the visible spectrum; each ray has a different power and purpose. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 5 rounds, regardless of any other effect. Any creature that is caught within the area of effect will be touched by one or more rays.

The Warden must be defeated in order to weaken the bonds enough to escape back to the prime material plane and &lt;a href=\"Athkatla\"&gt;Athkatla&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe demonic F/M with a Death Knight appearance will be located near its sadistic throne, along with any thralls and level dependent spawned creatures. The Warden does not venture away from this area unless it senses a party member in its detection range. Beware that it sees invisible and hidden creatures. \nThis demonic being only has moderate combat ability, with no proficiency with its wielded long sword &lt;a href=\"Adjatha%20the%20Drinker\"&gt;Adjatha the Drinker&lt;/a&gt;. This means it is really not a threat in melee combat. The developers may have made an error in its design, but regardless, it has certain mage like abilities, that cannot be disrupted and are mostly \"force-cast\". Some of the spells may get depleted through usage, and others have no limit. The creature also has no demonic immunities or protections, so any sort of weapon or elemental attack could work against it. It also has no inherent Magic resistance, which is unusual for a demonic creature. \nThe listing of memorized spells in the InfoBox is mostly accurate and reflects its capabilities. The scripted spells and spell attacks by the creature in the Classic and BG2EE version are nearly identical.\nExpect the creature to initially try and slay any freed thralls close by its throne area. The party may not be able to observe this, and it is likely the thralls will not last very long. Once the demon senses a party member, it will likely protect itself with a contingency of several self-buffs. \nThe creature will also attempt to dispel party members under certain status effects like Haste, Bless, Blur Improved Invisibility etc. Various damage dealing and disabling spells may be launched as well, and some will be bundled in sequencers. Instant death effects are possible from &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20Death%20%28wizard%29\"&gt;Finger of Death (wizard)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; options, so be careful when approaching the fell entity.\nHaving the thralls freed will help in defeating it. The Warden will blast any liberated thralls with a Sunfire as soon as they are no longer under the Thrall Collar power. A well timed &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Hasted&lt;/a&gt; fighter could make quick work of its rather mediocre 70 hit points. Due to his fantastic saving throw versus spells (1), you cannot count on the beast missing a save vs. spell.\nNote.\nThe Warden has no classification of gender in though it is male in the classic game .\nMod content.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Modification revises the Warden substantially. The creature is a level 18/18 Fighter/Conjurer. Statistics are changed including 18/76 STR, 16 DEX, 17 CON and 97 HP. It now has an adjusted Armor class of 0, and THAC0 of -2 with \"Adjatha the Drinker\". 2 pips in Long Sword weapon proficiency and 2 pips in single weapon fighting style are assigned. It now will strike 2.5 times per round with the sword. 50% Fire, Cold and 100% Electricity damage resistance is provided. \nThe Warden is also granted a base movement rate of 11 (2 faster than a regular humanoid), immunity to poison and poison damage, immunity to most Lightning based spells, and retains the ability to see the invisible.\nA new default AI script is implemented for the F/M class creature to improve tactical awareness, threat assessment and targeting behavior. New spell choices are also available. Expect the Warden to launch a series of uninterruptible self-protective buffs at the outset of hostilities to include &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Haste\"&gt;Improved Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity Divination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28spell%29\"&gt;Shield (spell)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stoneskin\"&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Non-Detection\"&gt;Non-Detection&lt;/a&gt;. If the Warden suffers any damage then there is contingency that will launch a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20From%20Magical%20Weapons\"&gt;Protection From Magical Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and this can occur up to two times during the battle.\nThe Warden will select offensive spells based on the AI's vulnerability assessments. Several Power word spells can be initiated with a casting time of 1, such as &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Blind\"&gt;Power Word, Blind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Stun\"&gt;Power Word, Stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Word%2C%20Kill\"&gt;Power Word, Kill&lt;/a&gt;. If the party is defended by spell protections or certain combat protections, then &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Thrust\"&gt;Spell Thrust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Ray%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Ruby Ray of Reversal&lt;/a&gt; will be attempted. Depending on the game difficulty selection, the Warden can use his &lt;a href=\"High-level%20class%20ability\"&gt;High-level class ability&lt;/a&gt; \"Improved Alacrity\", to cast several spells in succession in the same couple of rounds. The Warden has three prepared sequencers style spell casts ready to use:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Construction%20for%20Spellcasters\"&gt;Golem Construction for Spellcasters&lt;/a&gt; mod places a special \"Ruby\" component in the Warden's inventory."}

{"id": "4878", "revid": "44830706", "url": "https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4878", "title": "Project Image", "text": "Project Image creates an illusory copy of the caster which has the same spells and items from its parent at disposal.\nGameplay.\nThe caster applies this spell to self only.\nWhen the casting is finished, a short \"clone animation\" (a rising disc portal) plays adjacent to the caster, and the projected image clone appears on the map a few feet distance from the caster.\nAt this time the caster is unable to act or move in any way - the caster's character can be examined, but nothing on the character record is selectable and can't be accessed, moved, or manipulated. This state of inactive immobility will remain until the project image clone's existence expires/is destroyed, or until the caster suffers some kind of damage. Any damage incurred by the caster destroys the clone immediately.\nThe clone has hit points and can be affected by status effects as normal. It can be hurt/killed, stunned, held, webbed, slowed etc. If the clone is killed, it disappears from the map, and the caster may now act again.\nAs the created clone is an illusory creature, it is subject to being removed by &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects or destroyed by certain upper echelon divination attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"True%20Sight\"&gt;True Sight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt;, or a Thief's detect illusion skill. If the image is destroyed, the caster may act again.\nProject Image clones do not count toward the 5 summoned creature limit per area map. Perhaps they should, but they currently don't. The number of Project images on a map is only restricted by the party's ability to cast the spell and how long they last. \nWhat the project image clone can do.\nThe projected image clone is nearly identical to the caster. It can and must be controlled by the caster in order to do anything. It won't act on its own and has no actual AI script or default intelligence. \nThe clone may move and cast any memorized spells the caster had at the time the clone was created - it cannot however engage in combat with melee or missile weaponry that it has - this includes a weapon created by spells such as &lt;a href=\"Melf%27s%20Minute%20Meteors\"&gt;Melf's Minute Meteors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Blade\"&gt;Phantom Blade&lt;/a&gt;. This restriction also applies to a clone that has cast &lt;a href=\"Polymorph%20Self\"&gt;Polymorph Self&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt; - the shapechanged form's physical weapon, claws/tentacles can't be used to attack.\nThe image may also open up the \"Special Abilities\" menu and activate any of those abilities.\nThe clone is created with all of the caster's worn equipment items, and those items function on the clone. For example, A &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;Ring of Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Power\"&gt;Amulet of Power&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Elvenkind\"&gt;Boots of Elvenkind&lt;/a&gt; all provide their powers and ability modifiers to the clone.\nThe clone may use any items that are in the \"Quick Items\" slots at the time of its creation, such as scrolls, potions, wand or similar.\nSimilarly, items with use charges assigned to the image's equipped items, such as weapons, rings, helmet, etc. can be selected from the \"Use Item\" menu, as normal.\nAn image from a caster with thieving abilities is limited to only attempting to perform pickpocketing tasks - it can retain stolen items in its empty inventory slots (which will be dropped on the ground when the image is expired/destroyed); The image cannot set traps, and none will be found in the Special Abilities menu.\nProject image clone restrictions.\nWhen the project image is created, any spells/effects active on the caster are not transferred to the clone - the clone is created without any active spell effects on it (whether positive or negative effects, such &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blur\"&gt;Blur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Fire%20Giant%20Strength\"&gt;Potion of Fire Giant Strength&lt;/a&gt; or if the caster was suffering from poisoning or was slowed etc.\nThe image cannot engage another creature in dialogue or initiate a conversation - it also doesn't trigger dialogue from other creatures even if it is within the creature's dialogue activation range. The game's AI scripts don't recognize the image as a valid dialogue trigger.\nThe image cannot clear the fog of war and explore with its own sight radius, such as a familiar can or the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Eye\"&gt;Wizard Eye&lt;/a&gt; spell provides.\nThe clone isn't able to pick up loot (although the image's \"Quick Loot\" button will show the loot), interact with containers, pull levers, push buttons, open or close doors, or transition to other area maps - the image also is unable to receive items into its inventory from other party members, and nor can any of its equipment or items be moved/transferred/dropped.\nThe image cannot activate the \"Find Traps/Detect Illusions\" button, nor the \"Stealth\" button.\nThe caster's sequencers, spell trigger and contingency type buttons don't transfer to the image and thus aren't available to use. If the clone attempts to create its own sequencer for use, the game allows the spell to be selected and a short casting animation will play out, but the creation menu doesn't progress, and the creation process is finished/nothing was accomplished.\nAn image that casts/uses a scroll to attempt a &lt;a href=\"Mislead\"&gt;Mislead&lt;/a&gt;, another \"Project Image\", or a &lt;a href=\"Simulacrum\"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; will begin the casting sequence, but the spell will fail and not achieve anything - the same applies if the image activates &lt;a href=\"Vhailor%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Vhailor's Helm&lt;/a&gt;; a clone cannot create another clone of itself.\nAn image from a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20/%20Mage\"&gt;Cleric / Mage&lt;/a&gt; or similar multiclass/ dual class that has the &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; ability will have the ability button available on the clone's character record. The ability button can be selected to switch on the turn undead power - however, it doesn't actually radiate the effect and thus does nothing to affect undead creatures. It seems that the divine power granted by the deity to turn, destroy or control undead is not passed on to the image.\nNotes - previous spell versions.\nThis spell has had numerous revisions, tweaks and coding changes made to it, almost all from the Beamdog studio developers. There were issues with the original spell deemed necessary to correct. and they did correct a number of mechanics and imposed some needed restrictions. Even so, there are other changes that may be dealt with at a later date, or not. The spell as it is in the EE 2.6.6 update is the culmination of all the changes that are touched on shown below.\nTrivia.\nThe Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition Player's Handbook has \"Project Image\" as a level 6 Wizard spell. It differs in several ways from the one implemented by the BG video game. For example, the image created is nonmaterial, and solid forces/attacks pass through it leaving the image untouched. The image must be within view of the wizard projecting it at all times, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell is broken. The Wizard is able to move, and to attack while projecting an image, but there are some limitations based on the what the image is being controlled to do. See the External links for further reading.\nMod Content.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; mod has changed this arcane spell, revising its effects and description. See below:\nProject Image\nLevel: 7\nSchool: Illusion\nRange: Personal\nDuration: 1 round/level\nCasting Time: 1\nArea of Effect: Caster\nSaving Throw: None\nWhen this spell is cast, an illusory copy of the casting wizard appears to step out of his body while at the same time the mage is concealed with invisibility. The image can move around and has the same hit points and can cast the same spells as the wizard, but it cannot make any physical attacks. The caster must maintain concentration on the illusory clone for the duration of the spell and cannot perform any other action while controlling it. If the image is destroyed, then the spell ends, and the caster can move again. If during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear, and the caster will be free to move around once more. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by a dispel magic or destroyed.\nInstallation of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Coast%20Stratagems\"&gt;Sword Coast Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; Mod makes changes to several spells, Including Project Image - but only if you are not playing with the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod. From the SCS Readme:\nPrevent clones made by the Simulacrum and Project Image spells from using their magic items (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)\nAt present, clones can use magic items belonging to their creator - even one-shot items - which arguably isn't what the spell is intended to do. This component blocks use of useable items, by greying out the quick-item bar for clones. Magic weapons, armour, and protective devices still function normally.\nAlso, with Spell Revisions - Note: &lt;a href=\"True%20Seeing\"&gt;True Seeing&lt;/a&gt; does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by project image or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions."}

There are many green robed tutors around the grounds who if talked to will each give you advice. Each tutor offers different advice.\nYou can talk to the people of &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; and some of them will give you sub-quests from which you can gain gold and experience. Before you agree to leave with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;, you should have at least 295 experience and about 200 gold pieces. Thieves get considerably more experience and treasure from the many locked chests in the area.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Shank\"&gt;Shank&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Priests%27%20Quarters\"&gt;Priests' Quarters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbos\"&gt;Carbos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bunkhouse\"&gt;Bunkhouse&lt;/a&gt; will attack you. They are easy to defeat as they both carry just a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and wear no armor.\nWhen you are finished in Candlekeep, talk to &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt; on the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; and the two of you will leave Candlekeep.\nOn the journey, you and Gorion will be ambushed by an &lt;a href=\"Sarevok%20Anchev\"&gt;armored figure&lt;/a&gt; and his lackeys. You will be hit by a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Arrow\"&gt;Flame Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and Gorion will die to save you. After the ambush you will wake up the following morning in the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Coastway\"&gt;Candlekeep Coastway&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0area, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt; will begin.\nAreas.\nAlmost the whole Prologue happens in &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep\"&gt;Candlekeep&lt;/a&gt; and its various buildings, except for the &lt;a href=\"Candlekeep%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; itself which can't be entered now. Only in the end, when leaving with &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Way\"&gt;Lion's Way&lt;/a&gt; will be visited, but as soon as &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; has recovered from the happenings there, &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt; begins.\nQuests.\nThere's only a small number of &lt;a href=\"quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; available during Prologue, with the \"Important Event\" obtained automatically at start. It will also automatically update once &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20One\"&gt;Chapter One&lt;/a&gt; has begun \u2013 all other quests have to be done before speaking of \"ready to go right now,\" when talking with &lt;a href=\"Gorion\"&gt;Gorion&lt;/a&gt;, or they remain unfinished.\nAll quests except one are automatically obtained by speaking with the respective quest giver the first time, in one case a second time after having done what he tells initially. Thus, other than \"not\" speaking with them, there's no chance to not obtain these quests or refuse them. Only the &lt;a href=\"An%20Errand%20for%20Fuller\"&gt;errand&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fuller\"&gt;Fuller&lt;/a&gt; has to be actively chosen from several dialogue options. \nNotable loot.\nAs this chapter marks the start of the of &lt;a href=\"Gorion%27s%20Ward\"&gt;Gorion's Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt;, and sufficient equipment is rare at the moment, this section lists what can be obtained \"freely\" by taking from chests and barrels or by solving the above-mentioned quests. It includes &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Piece\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, only obtainable with a certain &lt;a href=\"reaction\"&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; or the skills &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Pockets\"&gt;Pick Pockets&lt;/a&gt; (50 needed) and &lt;a href=\"Open%20Locks\"&gt;Open Locks&lt;/a&gt; (up to 65 needed).

They behave in some similar ways to a spell cast, but they are different as well. They can be scripted to a creature to use, they can be \"memorized\" but more often than not will just be included in a creature's script. They typically can be used multiple times per battle, on a timed basis, or if specific conditions have occurred during the encounter. Most Psionics launch and produce a projectile that travels toward the target at varying speeds, the same as spell would. There are exceptions as well.\nCharacteristics of psionics.\nA Psionic Ability is usually launched instantly or near instantly.\nA Psionic Ability is usually not interruptible like a regular spell cast, as they are \"ForceSpell\" cast (a scripting execution command) - there are a few exceptions, such as when a player character assumes a Mind Flayer form with the &lt;a href=\"Shapechange\"&gt;Shapechange&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nA Psionic Ability that is \"ForceSpell\" cast is usually not affected by &lt;a href=\"Miscast%20Magic\"&gt;Miscast Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects, &lt;a href=\"Deafness%20effect\"&gt;Deafness effect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; effects. No verbal or somatic component is necessary.\nA Psionic Ability is a typically a non-magical effect (when coded in that manner). Thus, they are not influenced by &lt;a href=\"Magic%20resistance\"&gt;Magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and typically cannot be touched or affected by &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; effects. As always, there are a few exceptions where the ability is not coded like this and is more spell-like than an innate non-magical design.\nA Psionic ability is usually not assigned to a \"School of Magic\" such as Necromancy, or Evocation, but some are. This means for some psionic abilities that specialist mages will get no saving throw modifiers against these powers, and the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Immunity\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt; arcane spell will not have any effect.\nA Psionic Ability typically has no assigned spell power level and is &lt;a href=\"Power%20level\"&gt;level 0&lt;/a&gt;. The practical outcome of this is that protective spells that block spell levels have no effect, like &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Globe%20of%20Invulnerability\"&gt;Minor Globe of Invulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Turning\"&gt;Spell Turning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Deflection\"&gt;Spell Deflection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Trap\"&gt;Spell Trap&lt;/a&gt; for example. There are a several exceptions to this.\nA Psionic Ability may however have an assigned \"secondary type\" as many spells have, such as \"Offensive Damage\" or \"Disabling\", or \"Illusionary protection\". Some psionic powers do not. "}

This feature is avoided by the wiki filling in that information.\nEven so, it may prove difficult to remember which globe does what, especially later in the adventure when managing an inventory. It will be up to the player to come up with some kind of tracking method.\nBugs.\nAs of BG2EE 2.6, The Purple Globe that heals the caster was asking for a target when none was required. This is identified and corrected in &lt;a href=\"The%20Enhanced%20Edition%20Fixpack%20%28EEFP%29\"&gt;The Enhanced Edition Fixpack (EEFP)&lt;/a&gt;. Ref: (globpur4.itm)"}

He says that a man named &lt;a href=\"Llynis\"&gt;Llynis&lt;/a&gt; was the murderer, and that he abducted Littleman. He asks that you get his teddy bear back for him so that he can finally rest. He also knows this murderer's current location.\nWalkthrough.\nThe murderer is Llynis, and has a room at the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Coronet\"&gt;Copper Coronet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athkatla%20Slums\"&gt;Athkatla Slums&lt;/a&gt;. The room is the westernmost of the suite of rooms on the upper floor.

Although Llynis is a thief by trade, he is apparently not very good at noticing being pick pocketed himself.\nIf you confront him and ask for the bear, depending on the dialogue option you choose, Llynis will either attack you, or hand the bear over peacefully. Either way, you might as well loot his room when he's gone.\nReturn to the graveyard in the evening or at night and speak to Wellyn again. He will be so happy and will finally be able to rest in peace. The party receives .\nLater on, visit Wellyn's grave site in the morning and speak to his parents (named \"Mourners\" in-game). They will be overjoyed that their little boy can finally sleep peacefully. The party will get an additional 5,000 XP.\nNotes.\nIf the player is not interested in returning the Littleman stuffed bear to Wellyn's spirit then a dialogue option can be selected, as follows:\nAnd in an angry hoarse whisper Wellyn will reply:\nAfter this the spirit transforms into a &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Valley%20of%20the%20Tombs%29\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; creature and attacks in rage at the party's selfish attitude. Defend yourself! \nIf this occurs, then obviously no experience point awards are made available from the spirit or his parents. \nAchievements.\nBest Friends.\nReturn &lt;a href=\"Wellyn\"&gt;Wellyn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Littleman%20the%20Stuffed%20Bear\"&gt;missing bear&lt;/a&gt;."}

The encounter has voice acting on some lines.\nWhen you first see him (he has the \"fat Man\" animation) he'll be with two Dockhand &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. When you get within a certain range with a party member, Qadeel can be overheard with a raised voice saying \"Work faster, you useless dogs! Faster, I say! We shall never have the ships loaded on time if you continue to be so lazy!\"\nThe Dockhand Ogres complain and tell him that one of them is sick - it grunts \"Gurgh be sick! Sick! He must slow, master!\". Qadeel starts shouting again saying \"Don't force me to get the whip out, you moronic twits! Keep loading, I say! KEEP LOADING!\"\nAt this point some of your party members may have some interjections about this, such as Valygar or Aerie. Afterwards the ogres lose control and begin threatening Qadeel in a fit of rage.\nYou can now do nothing and watch what happens or try and save Qadeel's skin by attacking the Ogres, or you could help the poor brutes out and put Qadeel in an early grave, or just let the Ogres handle the killing by themselves. If you intercede on his behalf, Qadeel will have some thankful dialogue. He'll hand you a reward of 200 gold, and the party gains 6.500 XP. If you get rid of Qadeel by way of violence, the Ogres will just lumber off and leave - now free of being abused. The Ogres are only worth 270 XP each. If your party wishes, they can loot Qadeel's smushed, crushed and slushed body for 200 gold, which should clean-up nicely with a little elbow grease.\nFor an extra 3500 XP you can kill Quadeel *after* talking to him to get the above reward with no implications on your reputation.\nMore parting comments are possible, from Jaheria. Thus ends the dockside ruckus. The local Ogre Stevedore Union is apparently quite weak in Athkatla."}

These magicians have an extended lifespan. Qais is part of Hexxat's second quest, to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Unproved\"&gt;Shroud of the Unproved&lt;/a&gt; for her master \"L\" (Larloch). \nGame Play.\nEach magician has some dialogue, which will begin when Hexxat enters the library, and if she is visible. Diya al-Hafiz initiates the dialogue. All dialogue choices eventually lead to hostility with the magicians.\nOnce Hostile, the magicians cast Spell Deflection and Stoneskin, followed by an obscure reference to a \"Tatoo of Power' or other \"Tatoo\" variations - this is just embellished text for dramatic effect (there is no \"Tatoo of Power\" spell in the game). Mirror images may be cast, perhaps Power Word, Silence. Offensively they will use Greater Malison and Lightning Bolts or Chain Lightning. Most of their memorized spells are not used. They do not attempt to Breach a target, nor do they try and take down any spell protections. They will cast a single target spell at a party member that is protected from single target spells, like Spell Deflection or Spell Trap. \nOne peculiar thing about these spell casters is that thy all cast the same spell, at the same target, at the same time. For instance, you might be on the receiving end of three Greater Malison, or three Power Word, Silence spells.\nThe AI for these creatures is not very adaptable, and does not react to what spells or protections your party has up. They do not move out of clouds or AOE spells if there are no opponents in their visual range. If anyone is within their visual range they will attempt to close the distance to cast spells at them. They cannot open the door to the library if you close it, but they will follow the party if the door is left open. For example, you could fire a &lt;a href=\"Cloudkill\"&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/a&gt; into the library, then close the door, and you may slay the whole group without any dialogue being uttered. These creatures are humans, not Undead or ghosts of some sort. They have no special immunities, or secret buffs. Their undroppable Stoneskin amulet does however provide them with at least one instance of Stoneskin.\nAlthough Qais is a level 20 Sorcerer, he has no memorized 8th or 9th level spells. Qais also is provided with four memorized Cleric Spells.\nMod Content.\nInstallation of &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Revisions\"&gt;Spell Revisions&lt;/a&gt; Mod will update this creature's spell book to the SR versions. For instance, instead of the 5th level spell &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; cast at the party, it will be the SR spell \"Waves of Fatigue\". Instead of the 7th Level Spell &lt;a href=\"Mantle\"&gt;Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, it will the SR version \"Prismatic Mantle\"."}
