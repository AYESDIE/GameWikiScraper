After the inauguration of the Terminid Research Preserve, Acamar IV was been left under \"Terminid\" control, while in reality just serving as a experimental craddle for Terminids to be studied \"in the wild\". As such, it was under Super Earth control but appeared as Terminid controlled on the Galactic Map.\nOn November 12th, a massive breach in the Terminid Research Preserve occured and Acamar IV immediately returned to total Terminid control, which triggered Terminid assaults on all of the planets connected to Acamar IV.\nTopography.\nAcamar IV is a rugged and wild planet, with dramatic mountain peaks and rocky highlands. The defining feature of the planet is its mountains, which cover much of the landscape. These are broken up by green and fertile valleys and a jagged mist covered coastline.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nSupercolony Spore Outbreak.\nThe planet of Acamar IV was initially able to avoid the worst of the second galactic civil war, until massive bug outbreaks suddenly erupted across the planet, along with nearby &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt;. The spores that caused these outbreaks being identified as originating from the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridian Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, which was producing far more spores than other infested planets, leading to unpredictable outbreaks within its vicinty. The researchers of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; set to work searching for an effective countermeasures, though in the meantime Helldiver Corps was ordered to contain these outbreaks, before they could spread out of control.\nIn these efforts, they were partially successful, with the outbreaks on Heeth, Angel's Venture and Veld being brought under control. However the outbreak on Acamar IV was only partially contained when the major order finally expired, with the &lt;a href=\"terminids\"&gt;terminids&lt;/a&gt; spawning yet more agents of tyranny. Even worse however is what kind of effect these spores will have on the planets topography, though if Meridia is any indication, it can't be anything good.\nAs such, evacuation orders were issued for all nearby planets in the Jin Xi Sector and beyond. The citizens of Super Earth were forced to flee their homes, with only the clothes on their backs and their family flags. Yet this is unlikely to be the last of the necessary evacuations or outbreaks, which must be contained until the Ministry of Science finds a way to combat the Supercolony.\nDespite the valiant, unmeasured efforts of the Helldivers, Acamar would end up being too late for liberation. The Ministry of Humanity wants all readers to allocate 1 full minute of their lunch break in order to commemorate all the lives lost in this unforeseeable, inevitable calamity.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nAcamar IV, while being lost during the initial Supercolony Spore Outbreaks, would not be lost outright, instead enduring several weeks of liberation campaigns and recaptures due to the persistent connection to the Meridia Supercolony. However, its salvation would come from a dangerous, unlikely source. Scientists in Moradesh had been tasked with manufacturing a new type of super-weapon, rooted in recovered technology from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;: The Dark Fluid, a weapon capable of artificially creating black holes.\nOn May 28, 2184, the Super Earth High Command made the decision to deploy the Dark Fluid on Meridia, which would obviously and regrettably mean its destruction. From May 28 to May 29, the Helldivers fought to hold a line of planets that connected Moradesh to Meridia, which were &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;, Turing and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;. Then, from May 29 to May 30, the Helldivers would fight tooth and nail to deploy the Dark Fluid, keeping away the hordes of Terminids as they drilled the Dark Fluid into the surface of the Supercolony. By the afternoon of May 30, the Dark Fluid had managed to reach critical mass and collapsed into a black hole, destroying the Terminid Supercolony for good and siphoning away all of its spores into itself, crippling the Terminid advance and paving the way for a counter-attack.\nFrom May 31st on, Acamar IV, along with Erata Prime, Turing and Phact Bay, are on the sights of Super Earth, their liberation now imminent. The Major Order was completed on June 6th.\nFalstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nFrom June 6th onwards, Acamar IV would see mostly peace, with only occasional Terminid assaults touching it, mostly coming from neighboring Gacrux. Even as other planets like Pandion XXIV and Phact Bay saw much worse invasions, Acamar IV would remain mostly untouched and would spend the majority of the major order under firm Super Earth control.\nOperation Righteous Expunge (July 18th - July 21st).\nAcamar survived most of the anti-bot operation in tenuous peace. On morning of July 20th, SEAF infrastructure reported Terminid Spores reaching the planet surface. Bugs immediately begun spreading, and the Terminids inside E-710 farms went rabid as hivemind established itself on planet. Scant SEAF forces were overwhelmed on following day.\nOperation Glorious Xenocide (July 21st - July 23rd).\nDuring the break between Major Orders, majority of Helldivers redeployed onto Acamar to contain the bug infestation before it could spread further into &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; sector, as well as &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly thereafter, a major Terminid Spore Barrage has hit neighboring &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, winch was swiftly defended. Following in their decisive strike, full planetary control over Acamar was re-established in morning of July 23rd, and any runaway bugs were herded back into their sufficiently sized pens.\nOperation Brute Force.\nFollowing its liberation, Acamar IV would spend the rest of July and the 2 weeks of August in well-earned freedom, with the only minor interruption being a Terminid outbreak that would be quickly repelled during Operation Benevolent Sanitation. However, it would be during Operation Lighthouse that Acamar IV would face the new horrors that the Terminids were bringing. With the apparition of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, the Terminids were now bolstered and began to launch multiple successive assaults, with Acamar IV being assaulted at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;. Acamar IV's defense would honorably sacrifice itself in order to allow the Helldivers to concentrate on Erata Prime so that the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt; remained unsurpassed. Acamar IV would fall to the Terminid infestation and remain as such for 4 long, horrid days as the Helldivers were ordered back towards the Automatons as they advanced into the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, once the robotic threat was repelled, the Helldivers would be ordered back to the Terminid Front. After the sabotaging of Operation Prometheus, Super Earth High Command was detecting rapid spreading of the Gloom's intergalactic Terminid spores. As such, they issued a major order in order to hold back the incoming fascist nebula while culling as many Terminids, and especially &lt;a href=\"Bile%20Titan\"&gt;Bile Titans&lt;/a&gt;, as possible.\nWhile Acamar IV was not part of the operation's targets, it wound up being liberated on August 24th, shortly after nearby Crimsica. Acamar IV's liberation would happen at just the right time since, some hours later, the Terminids would begin a dual assault onto &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;, which would enjoy all of the Helldivers' attention now that the Gloom was beginning to slow down its expansion in the face of the mighty Super Earth.\nOperation Leap Forward.\nAcamar IV would remain free for the rest of August and most of September. However, the Terminids would not allow that freedom to last. On September 24th, mere days after being righteously dislodged from Pandion XXIV, the Terminids launched an assault onto the underdefended Acamar IV. Due to the required focus on the Automaton-controlled &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;, Acamar would fall to Terminid control the next day.\nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nHowever, this would not be the end of it as, pretty much a day later, the Terminids at Acamar immediately made a move for Turing. However, this move couldn't have been timed any worse, as Super Earth had just issued plans for the construction of a Xenoentomology Center in order to make the Super Destroyers' Alcubierre Warp Drives more efficient in their E-710 consumption. As such, the Helldivers were ordered to hold Turing by all means. After a whole 2 days of defending the planet, the unusually resilient Terminid onslaught was repelled and sent back to Acamar IV, where part of the Helldiver Corps gave chase but couldn't really make much breakthroughs, as the Bugs had managed to deeply entrench themselves into Acamar IV.\nOnce the Helldivers repelled the assault on Turing, they immediately set up Acamar IV's liberation as a secondary objective for the operation, as Acamar IV presented the most immediate threat against the construction of the Xenoentomology Center. For 6 days, the Helldivers fought tooth and nail over Acamar, making slow but steady progress towards the grassy planet's liberation until, on October 3rd, Acamar IV would be liberated almost on tandem with the nearby defensive victory at Turing, which completely crushed the Terminids and allowed the Xenoentomology Center to be completed, granting the Helldivers victory.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nShortly after the victory at Operation Alcubierre-II, the Xenoentomology Center would see a special need to study the Terminids on a \"natural\" environment. However, the SEAF was wary of the Terminids being left unchecked. As such, a Terminid Research Preserve had to be constructed in a planet neighboring Turing. And the best fit was Acamar IV, which had been recently liberated.\nThis research preserve was to be heavily guarded and monitored, as Terminids would be carefully seeded into the planet and continuously monitored and contained with electrified fences and armed guards. However, for this to work, Acamar IV had to be completely detached from the main Terminid broods at its adjacent planets. As such, on October 11th, the order was given for all of the planets connected to Acamar IV to be taken and held by the Helldivers for 6 days while the Terminid Research Preserve was constructed.\nAfter some initial pacification efforts and the preventive closing of FTL Supply Lines, Acamar IV would be designated as a \"Demilitarized Terminid Zone\", meaning that it would appear as if it was under Terminid control on the Galactic Map but its FTL Supply Lines were still usable by all Super Earth vessels.\nOn October 18th, Acamar IV's supply lines had been secured and the Terminid Research Preserve had been opened. Terminids had been seeded carefully into the planet and were heavily monitored by SEAF Wardens at all times of the solar cycle, contained with electrified fences both above and below ground and, in case of a Terminid outbreak, nuclear bombardment was set to automatically initiate upon the first signs of a containment breach.\nFor the civilian population, a new section called the \"Tyranny Park\" was opened, meant to allow the bolder civilians among the population to visit and even participate in tours called \"Big Tyrant Hunts\", meant to fund the Terminid Research Preserve and encourage the general population to deepen their understanding of the Terminids' horrid fascism and, obviously, how to appropriately deal with the insects.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nAcamar IV would have remained pretty much untouched after the inauguration of the Terminid Research Preserve. In the weeks that proceeded it, many advancements were made and the Democracy Space Station would be completed thanks to its contributions. However, not everything was going to go right for the grassy planet. On October 24th, Gacrux and Pandion-XXIV fell to a Terminid attack from &lt;a href=\"Partion\"&gt;Partion&lt;/a&gt;, which left Acamar IV exposed to the main Terminid territories and the Gloom's influence until both planets were liberated 6 days later. At the time, it seemed nothing had happened, but this lack of caution would be the spark that ultimately spelled disaster for Acamar IV.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Automaton Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nWhile Turing was able to be saved, the tragedy at Acamar IV was a complete military disaster, product of dissidents among the Helldiver Corps that caused their attention to be divided and their focus to be lost in the moment when it counted most.\nAs Acamar IV's liberation campaign is underway, millions of refugees poured into the Celeste Sector through Turing, fleeing from the violence as their homes burned and the SEAF scrambled to alleviate the situation.\nOn November 17th, Acamar IV would be liberated, shortly after the arrival of the Democracy Space Station. With it, the Helldivers would manage to quickly contain the Terminids and secure control of what little remained of the Terminid Research Preserve, as well as the ruins of the now devastated Tyranny Park."}

Its colonists, for the most part, dedicated themselves to agriculture and fishing while inhabiting its green pastures.\nHowever, the would soon throw their plans off schedule when, on October 13th, pretty much immediately after capturing Gar Haren, they invaded Achernar Secundus, as they raced to flank the SEAF's hardened defense at through &lt;a href=\"Achird%20III\"&gt;Achird III&lt;/a&gt; in order to reach &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the newly built Xenoentomology Center. However, the bugs didn't count with the resilience of Super Earth's colonists. For 12 hours, they valiantly held the lines side by side with their brethren of the Colonial Defense Forces and a contingent of Helldivers that had decided to support the ongoing defense. However, as the hours passed, the situation looked bleaker and the casualties began to mount.\n16 hours into the assault, the situation looked desperate. Civilians were being evacuated in disarray while the SEAF was preparing to evacuate the planet. All hope seemed lost until, on October 14th, at 3:45 SEST, Darius II was liberated and soon, an additional 30,000 Super Destroyers showed up en masse to relief the besieged defense of Achernar Secundus.\nBy 13:00 SEST, the last remaining Terminids of the invading force had been repelled and Achernar was successfully defended, cleansing the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; off the Borgus Sector.\nOperation Bughammer.\nOn the 11th of December, 2184, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt; officially awarded a multitrillion-Supercredit contract to Admiral (AM) Defense to expand production of high-quality military equipment for the Helldivers. It should be noted that AM Defense has a proven history of constructing top-of-the-line armaments for SEAF line units, and their expansion to providing Helldiver weaponry marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the Defense-Marketplace Partnership.\nTo begin this new chapter, AM Defense began construction of a massive, multi-complex Factory Hub on &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, which would create millions of exciting labor opportunities for Super Earth citizens. However, temperature readings shows an increase of Terminid activity in the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Sector\"&gt;Sten&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, seemingly in response to this momentous project. Indeed, this lead credence to the theory proposed by many Terminid experts that the alien race may instinctively sense and attack areas with heavy Democratic activity. Never the less, the Helldivers were ordered to ensure the construction of the AM Defense Factory Hub continued unabated, in order to protect the investments of the Ministry of Defence's security partners.\nHowever Operation Bughammer was swiftly cancelled following the 's return to the galaxy and the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, with the majority of Helldiver and SEAF forces being redirected to the galactic &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Front\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; to meet this new threat head on. Fortunately for the galaxy, they were successful and the Admiral Defense (AM) Factory Hub didn't need their protection after all, with construction being completed on the 17th of December. Production of &lt;a href=\"M-102%20Fast%20Recon%20Vehicle\"&gt;Fast Recon Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; (FRVs) for all Helldiver battlespaces was on schedule to begin within the following days and soon become available just in time to take part in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Prime\"&gt;Genesis Prime&lt;/a&gt; against another &lt;a href=\"illuminate\"&gt;illuminate&lt;/a&gt; incursion.\nReturn of the Illuminate.\nAchernar Secundus, being left completely unattended due to the ongoing crisis in the southern sectors, would quickly be put under siege, as the Terminids advanced onto &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt; and then Gar Haren. Things were looking pretty grim as the SEAF Garrison began to build up its defenses in preparation for a Terminid attack. However, the threat upon them would come from the last side anyone could have prepared them for.\nOn December 19th, shortly after the Illuminate raid at &lt;a href=\"Gemma\"&gt;Gemma&lt;/a&gt;, an Illuminate raiding party turned up on the planet's surface and began to attack the more urbanized settlements of the planet, aiming to plunder the resources and personnel that AM Defense had brought in order to build the multi-complex factory hub.\nFearing the worst, the Helldivers immediately deployed onto Achernar, in hopes that a victory over the Illuminate would not only prevent interruptions to AM Defense's vehicle production but also deter future Terminid incursions. This raid would only end in disaster for the Illuminate, as the Helldivers managed to succesfully repel the raid in less than 6 hours.\nTrivia.\nThe system bears the traditional name of Achernar (sometimes spelled Achenar), derived from the Arabic \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0631 \"\u0101khir an-nahr\", meaning \"The End of the River\".\nAchernar is the brightest star in the constellation of Eridanus and the ninth-brightest in the night sky.\nSecundus is the Latin word for \"second.\" However, it also had the meaning of \"favorable\" or \"lucky.\" It functions both as a proper name and a numeral title."}

By and large though the planet is dominated by a series of continent mesas and plateaus, some of which are the size of skyscrapers. This has created an unexpected challenge for Helldivers operating on the planet, as this geography has been reported to obstruct some stratagems.\nIron minerals, and particularly hematite, are responsible for coloring the planet's sedimentary rock layers, which when combined with the planet's seismic instability has created large quantities of dust due to soil surface disturbance. This combined with strong winds has resulting in a fine layer of red dust that covers most of the planet which has also been known to clog up both unprotected machinery as well as lungs.\nThe majority of plant life on the planet consists of dry grasslands and shrub lands, with the arid nature of Achird III also driving the evolution of exceptionally efficient water usage in its various organisms.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nAchird III had been, up until September 2184, just another colony of Super Earth in which not many events worthy of remark had occured. During the early Terminid outbreak in February, the colonists at Achird III narrowly avoided devastation thanks to the Colonial Overseer's careful move of cutting their planet's FTL Line with Turing, which was under heavy attack from the Terminids. But, this move was not going to keep the colonists at Achird III safe forever.\nFrom February to September, the colonists at Achird III watched attentively how the war came at went from their doorstep at nearby Turing. But then, an unexpected surprise struck at them. On September 29th, neighboring Darius II would fall to a sudden Terminid attack from &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Then, during the early morning of September 30th, the Terminids hopped from Darius to Achird III, sending a massive attack in order to flank the SEAF defensive line at &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; to try and attack the Xenoentomology Center at Turing.\nHowever, this attack would ultimately turn out unsuccessful, as the Helldivers managed to gather enough manpower to repel the Terminid assault under 12 hours.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nAchird once again came under attack shortly after announcement of Operation Ring of Freedom. Despite not being the target of the Major Order, its position as a stepping stone towards Turing made it obvious bugs would use it as staging ground for their next infestations. Helldivers mobilized enmasse to save this planet from facist incursion.\nDespite the importance, the defense was suffering from lack of reinforcements, as the majority of divers continued their work on Pandion XXIV. It was only during the early hours of October 12th, that divers begun to move towards Achird III, as more and more begun to realize the defense is possible. \nWith heroic fervor, Helldivers fought with guns and nails to save the world, eventually turning the tide of battle less than 2 hours before bugs amassed critical mass on the surface. With less than 8 minutes to spare, the \"Achird Miracle\" was declared with the chorus of Divers across the entire planet, as last nests were destroyed, and last bugs, slaughtered.\nThe defense of Achird III once again proved just how powerful liberty can become against the evils of tyranny. Super Earth High Command would commemorate the remarkable and admirable defense of the planet, stating that this level of high valor and bravery by the Helldivers had not been seen since much earlier in the Second Galactic War in the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; against the . To all the soldiers who participated and gave their lives in the defense of Achird III, particularly into the nighttime and morning hours of the battle, this here stands as their recognition and commemoration of their service in the most high stakes of situations."}

Having been settled after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; had come to an end, Acubens' colonists would struggle at the start, having to deal with the mysterious alien flora and fauna on the planet. But as is built into humankind's lineage, determination and perseverance allowed the colonists to slowly master their environment.\nFrom the alien flora, they began to learn more about xenophytology than what any other xenophytologist could have learned anywhere else. Being born and raised in an environment teeming with the undiscovered plant life of an alien planet, the generations that followed grew up to become some of Super Earth's finest xenobiologists and made the inhabitants of the colony into grandmasters of botany, which would soon pave their way to fortune. With their gift to understand plant life on a deeper level than most other colonies in the Federation, Acubens Prime quickly cemented itself as a cornerstone of the sector's food supply, its agriculture vastly outpacing any other among its neighbour colonies, which combined with how it was at the perfect middle point between Super Earth and the galactic frontier allowed it prosperity unlike any other.\nThe citizens of Acubens would see the fruits of their labour and tradition manifested as beautiful urbanized settlements, with a sustainable energy grid, an enviable water supply, top-of-the-line waste management, paved roads and, most importantly, pristine grass lawns for the proud children of Managed Democracy to pitch their Super Earth flags and erect Helldiver memorials in.\nHowever, during all this time, the remnant of a long vanquished evil lurked in the shadows, waiting for the moment to pounce. The , an old foe that had once defied Humanity, had impossibly resurafced back from their presumed extinction.\nOn December 18th, early in the morning, the Illuminate launched 2 coordinated strikes on the Southern sectors of the Federation. Alongside Acubens, the Illuminate also attacked &lt;a href=\"Andar\"&gt;Andar&lt;/a&gt;, another planet colony. The Helldivers; having already faced and repelled Illuminate raids at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bellatrix\"&gt;Bellatrix&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, heeded the call for aid and deployed on both planets, aiming to end the senseless pillaging of the illustruous colonies."}

Its landscape generally consists of dead, coral-like flora with the occasional purple parasitic flower growing on top of it, similar to &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;\nThis planet marks one of the borders between the &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Sector\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sectors&lt;/a&gt;, as it contains one of the only FTL line that goes into it through &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;, the other being &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;. \nTopography.\nA cold, grey and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. The low temperatures cause evaporation of water to be slow. Much of the planet experiences seasonal rain and fog in the summers, as water gathers in bogs and ponds. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses, lichens and violet flowers seen on other primordial worlds.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFor the most part Aesir Pass was able to avoid the rigors of the second galactic war, at least until the Automaton reclamation and their surprise invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis sector&lt;/a&gt;. With the Automaton fleet advancing towards super earth, High Command established the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the fleet, however the Automaton's then attempted to go around the line by trying to flank through &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; and then, presumably, continue their advance through Aesir Pass, but thankfully the attempt was thwarted on Menkent and so Aesir Pass was able to avoid becoming a battlefield... for the time being.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; breach and the attack on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;; war would come to Aesir and after the official declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny, the planet would be one of the four chosen by Super Earth High Command to be the location of new training facilities, required to process the Billions of able-bodied citizens from across the Federation who volunteered for conscription. \nOperation Destiny Manifested.\nAesir Pass would go through the rest of the month of May untouched, save for a couple Automaton assaults that would be quickly repelled. However, as Super Earth High Command refocused its efforts into the containment of the Terminid Supercolony, the Automaton Front slowly collapsed, with Vernen Wells falling during Operation Freedom's Calling and having its forward base destroyed, which permanently crippled the SEAF's ability to assist the Helldivers in liberation campaigns.\nShortly after the destruction of Meridia, as new liberation campaigns were ordered, Aesir Pass would face its third Automaton assault of the war, now being very understaffed and undersupplied. By June 6, Aesir Pass had fallen and its SEAF Training Facilities were destroyed.\nOperation Trolley Problem (June 11th - 12th).\nOn June 11th, High Command has recieved two urgent pleas for rescue. One coming from &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, and other from &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. From Wells, plea for rescue of civilians stranded in Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children, while the one from Marfark shown that &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; hold hostage the final components for &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;Anti Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt;, stolen from &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt;. With both planets behind the frontlines, Helldivers decided to begin their breakthrough on Aesir Pass. \nBy June 12th, the Helldivers successfully liberated Aesir Pass, allowing the battle to flow towards both of the planets designated for liberation by the Major Order, with Vernen Wells being the clear favorite. \nOperation Starslayer.\nWhilst the details of the project remain highly classified, during the first Galactic War an advanced weapons lab on the planet of &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was working on the development of a powerful interplanetary battle station. However the project was abandoned along with the laboratory (and the planet) due to high levels of radiation on X-45 -- possibly nuclear in nature. \nAutomatons shortly after learnt of this endeavor through cyber attacks on Super Earth network infrastructure, and launched a series of massive attacks from neighboring &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; on July 3rd, 2184. At the same time, SEAF has announced a massive mobilization of troops on Aesir Pass, to further strike at automatons once the excavation on X-45 ends. The amassment of troops was interrupted on afternoon of July 6th, when Automatons, fearing a cut off from their southern claims, attacked the pass with massive force. With Helldivers already stretched thin in Ymir sector, and other half of their force farming Terminids, the defense prospect looked grim. The stationed SEAF infantry fought to their last man, as the Helldivers, being stretched between the defenses of Meissa, Vega Bay and Aesir Pass, could not arrive in time to help relief their brethren. \nHowever, their sacrifice was not in vain, as despite all the losses, X-45 would be successfully defended and the plans for the intergalactic battle station secured.\nOperation Andromeda.\nWith hearts heavy from the recent massacre, and shortly after conducting a short weapons test on the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;, Super Earth Command would issue a new major order: In the name of the slain SEAF soldiers and with the momentum behind them after their victory on X-45, the Helldivers now had to secure Aesir Pass, alongside Marfark, &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;. Being the first planet in line, Aesir Pass was liberated first, allowing the Helldivers to pass onto Marfark to continue their quest for Liberation.\nOperation Righteous Expunge.\nHowever, Aesir Pass would not be allowed to enjoy its freedom for too long. As the Helldivers continued their push to crush the newly made &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;, the bots would begin scheming in devious manners. As the Helldivers began to divert more and more forces into the encircled planets, the bots would advance on Aesir Pass in a double assault that they would conduct against it and Matar Bay. However, at the time, their victory was short lived as, while they captured Aesir Pass, they weren't able to break the line separating them from the encirclement, as the assault on Matar Bay was successfully repelled.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nDespite this, the Automatons continued their maleficent machinations. On the morning of August 10th, the Automatons made their first move towards Super Earth since the invasion of the Valdis Sector and launched a massive attack on the planet of Curia. Occupied with higher priority operations, such as the valiant rescue of &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; amidst the apparition of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would be spread to thin, having to capture both Troost and Vandalon IV while holding the line against the bolstered Terminids. Curia, despite its brave and courageous defense, would be captured, its colonists being mercilessly massacred as the few survivors that remained went into hiding throughout its surface to mount a valiant resistance against the heartless machines.\nOperation Crossroads.\nAesir Pass would remain untouched after Operation Lighthose, as the Automaton Vanguard at Curia would be ultimately defeated after Operation Ecologic Immolation. However, this victories wouldn't bring Aesir Pass the peace it had been robbed of by the Automatons. With the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; beginning at nearby &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons began to bolster their forces, expanding the conflict into the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus&lt;/a&gt; sectors. However, once the Automatons were righteously dislodged out of Gaellivare and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt;, the self-actuated assailants would turn their forces westward once more. After stealing whatever scrap metal and lost gear they could from captured planets and fallen Helldivers, the Automatons would unleash a new horrid foe onto the front: The Jet Brigade.\nThis abominable force would go on to capture &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; in just 2 days, as the Automatons went on a blind search for the Democracy Space Station, having learned of its existence through malicious cyberattacks. However, after the defense of Marfark, the robots would be stopped and the Jet Brigade repealed yet not entirely destroyed. As such, Super Earth was in desperate need of reinforcing the Democracy Space Station's security, with nearby &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; being the priority target.\nHowever, the situation would complicate itself soon, as the Terminids would then begin an offensive towards &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, aided by a spore surge originating from within the Gloom. As such, with Liberty Day right around the corner, the Helldivers had to make a choice: Liberating Lesath, safeguarding the DSS, or defending the Terminid Research Preserve. The Helldiver Corps would choose the former and began immediate deployments onto Lesath. However, Lesath's liberation would end up costing more than just the setbacks on the Terminid front. On October 23rd, just as the Terminids started to overwhelm the defenses at &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons began a counteroffensive and immediately began to assault Aesir Pass. Due to the majority of the Corps being split between Lesath and the Terminid front, the planet would see very few Helldivers come to its aid, and the planet would fall under Automaton control by the next day with no serious liberation efforts made on the planet following its defeat."}

Whilst originally a sparsely populated world, the planet became a major training ground for the Super Earth Armed Forces following the official declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny -- although this facility has since been shut down and turned into a campground for the Democratic Youth Scouts.\nAfter enduring tremendous suffering during Operation Enduring Peace, Angel's Venture now stands as the \"Heroic Diamond of the Orion Sector\"\nTopography.\nPossessing a boreal climate, Angel's Venture is chilly though not uncomfortably so. Continent-sized forests with towering trees and mountains cover vast tracts of land across surface of the planet, with mining, timber and agricultural products being its main exports.\nThe planet's lush green surroundings stand in stark contrast to the hideous rock-like hive structures of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;. Initial estimates of the damage done by the bugs to the planet's ecosystem range anywhere between 20% and 60%, with conservation efforts being undertaken by Colonial Authorities to preserve and restore its remaining natural beauty.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations prior to the Second Galactic War.\nEarly Terminid Outbreaks.\nAngel's Venture was the epicenter of heavy fighting during the February Counter-Offensive, when it was engulfed in Terminid spores along with &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt;. Though the colonial militias were initially overwhelmed, both planets were successfully defended from the fascist menace through the valiant efforts of the Helldivers.\nDisaster of Meridia.\nIn the late weeks of April and the first week of May 2184, &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; tragically became a Terminid Supercolony due to the failure of the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;. Though the rest of the TCS was quickly dismantled, massive outbreaks began on planets close to Meridia, Angel's Venture among them. The Helldivers were sent to these planets in order to contain the breach. While Angel's Venture, Heeth, and Veld were successfully defended, the containment operation was unsuccessful, as Acamar IV could not be cleansed.\nSecond Galactic War.\nThe Galactic War on Tyranny was officially declared on May 15, 2184 in response to hostile actions by the Terminids and the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. Angel's Venture was selected as one of four planets (alongside neighboring Heeth, &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;) that would host SEAF Training bases in order to allocate the millions of voluntary conscripts that had selflessly rushed to service.\nOperation Emancipator.\nAngel's Venture would remain secured for a while, even being spared the worst horrors that the war brought onto other planets. However, that was not to be the end. Shortly after the loss of the Vernen Wells Forward Base, a Terminid assault put Angel's Venture under siege while the Helldivers rushed to free &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; and its crucial \"Petrafactory\". Despite the diversion of manpower, the Helldivers managed to effortlessly repeal the Terminid assault on Angel's Venture \"and\" liberate Varylia 5, a typical show of the Helldivers' immaculate tactical skill and cunning.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nAngel's Venture was relatively spared from most of the cruelties of the war for some time. It saw one or two assaults from the Terminids, but these were easily repelled by the SEAF. Shortly after Operation Emancipator was completed, new orders came in: the Helldivers were to hold Angel's Venture, Fenrir III and Turing in order to create a safe passage for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;a new weapon&lt;/a&gt; that had been developed in order to permanently end the Meridia Supercolony. The skillful defense of Angel's Venture allowed the Helldivers to judiciously deploy this weapon across Meridia, resulting in its collapse into a black hole and ending the Supercolony once and for all.\nOperation Starslayer.\nWith emergency recruitment levels swelling ranks to targeted numbers, training throughput requirements have been reducing. In light of this change, the surviving emergency SEAF Training Facilities on &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; were shut down and converted into recreational campgrounds for the Democratic Youth Scouts.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nDuring Operation Courageous Exodus, Angel's Venture, alongside &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt; and the recently reconnected &lt;a href=\"Terrek\"&gt;Terrek&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen as one of the 3 sites from which millions of colonists, displaced by &lt;a href=\"the%20Gloom\"&gt;the Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, would be processed and relocated onto the Democracy Space Station in order for them to staff it. As such, this major order designated them as targets to be held throughout the duration of it.\nHowever, since the Terminids never got to any planets connected to Angel's Venture, it wouldn't see any need for protection, allowing its colonists to continue their daily democratic lives in unimpeded freedom."}

In this case, hitting 'Reload' will initiate the slow self-reload instead.\nBear in mind that the player who needs a reload must have the Recoilless Rifle weapon in their hands for another to be able to assist.

Even so these vessels remain capable warships, with the Super Earth Navy unable to completely halt the fleet's advance through direct means, necessitating the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; to slow them as much as possible through other means...\nGeneral.\nThe exact size of an Automaton fleet destroyer is currently up for debate, though from what can be seen, they are likely larger than Super Earth's own Super Destroyers. The Automaton fleet destroyer is also capable of FTL travel, though whether they make use of the Alcubierre Drive or some other method of interstellar flight is unknown. However it is likely that they are using inferior FTL drives, given that these ships can't navigate to any planet in the galaxy like the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; can, instead resorting to shorter range 'planet to planet' jumps, which has slowed the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; advance considerably.\nExterior.\nAutomaton fleet destroyer maintains the monolithic design seen in Automaton facilities and war machines, though is visually distinguished by it's two hexagonal hull sections (the forward \"Muzzle\" connecting to a central \"body\"), which then connects to a rectangular bank of engines. What the automaton warship lacks in aesthetics, the design likely makes up for in utility, by maximizing the thrust to weight and cargo ratio, whilst also presenting as few structural weaknesses as possible.\nInterior.\nThough no Helldiver has been ordered to board an Automaton fleet destroyer (yet), pictures of the vessel captured during the Automaton's conquest of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; show that the upper part of the central body of the Automaton fleet destroyer can open up like a pair of \"wings\", revealing a large cargo and hangar bay. This has been used to store smaller automaton craft, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dropship\"&gt;Dropship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;, which are then deployed from orbit. This was first seen during the reclamation, which was also the first time these space borne warships were sighted in large numbers.\nEverything else about the interior of the vessel is unknown, though it's safe to assume that the inner works of the ship are radically different from Super Earth's own designs. In any case, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; would no doubt love to get their hands on an intact Automaton fleet destroyer for further study, though for now that remains a pipe dream.\nArmament.\nThe primary armament of the Automaton fleet destroyer (as well as the likely the source of one of it's nicknames: \"The Stingray\") is a single large rail cannon directly connected to the engine block, which is then slung under the main body and runs the entire length of the ship. Presumably this cannon is based on the same weapons used by Automaton ground forces to shoot &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;super destroyers&lt;/a&gt; out of orbit, likely with similar destructive effect. The ship also has 26 (13 per side) broadside guns mounted on either side of the \"Muzzle\" of the vessel, meant for more close range engagements."}

Even so it is not unknown for a lucky shot to hit a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;super destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, in which case the vessel is usually obliterated in it's entirety.\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nAlthough the Automaton forces were still split in two from Operation Righteous Expunge, the socialist killing machines were also rapidly repairing their logistics and communications infrastructure, with their defenses similarly recovering. As such the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Super Earth Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; needed to maintain their offensive momentum, however, the Automatons devised a new means by which to retain their stolen territory. Anti-Orbital cannons.\nNow deployed in large numbers across the Automaton territories, firing on our fleet and seeking to challenge our aerial superiority. The Orbital Cannons targeted SEAF air forces, specifically, extending extraction times for &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; significantly. Fortunately, Super Earth Intelligence was able to identify a key flaw in the cannon's targeting systems, as they were interconnected with other similar systems spread across multiple planets.\nLiberating one Automaton planet would destabilize the entire system, allowing temporary return to normal extraction times as it re-calibrates. Furthermore, if two Automaton planets are liberated in short succession (within 12 hours of each other) the array would be severely destabilized, all but shutting it down and allowing for shorter extraction times for the remainder of the operation.\nUnfortunately despite the liberation of every target planet bar one, the valiant sacrifice of millions of Super Earth's most well-trained and brave heroes was not enough to pry free the Automaton's collectivist death-grip on the Federation's stolen worlds. Although the final holdout of &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; would be finally liberated on the 5th of August, by this point the Automaton's were able to deploy their Orbital Cannons across their entire domain.\nAs such the Orbital Cannons will likely be yet another metallic thorn in the side of Liberty going forward. Fortunately the pilot shortages created by the loss of so many ships have since been replenished, with additional training instilled into new recruits in order to limit further impacts to extraction times. Even so, Helldiver missions to destroy these cannons will remain critical to the war effort in perpetuity."}

The Automatons have shown to be \"Socialist\" due to having the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_star\"&gt;Red Star&lt;/a&gt; as their emblem. \nGalactic Geography.\nThe Automatons occupy seven Sectors: &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lacaille%20Sector\"&gt;Lacaille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Sector\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus&lt;/a&gt;. They have also previously occupied six other Sectors, which are the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theseus%20Sector\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; sectors.\nThe Automatons reside on the Western side of the Galaxy, having reached as far as &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demiurg\"&gt;Demiurg&lt;/a&gt;. For three months the Legion held an impenetrable fortress in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;, but in only a few weeks the Automatons were pushed out of Federation space back to where they came from. Then, a mere 3 days after their eradication at &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons invaded the Valdis Sector and the rest of the north-western galactic rim, establishing their base of power at &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, the old homeworld of the . This attack has since been referred to as \"The Reclamation\", as this was the name that it was referred to within intercepted Automaton signals.\nFrom April to August, the Automatons expanded their odious fief, spanning a vast expanse that stretched from &lt;a href=\"Merga%20IV\"&gt;Merga IV&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; at the height of their power. However, this overextension was soon turned around, as the Helldivers severed the Automaton dominion in half during &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Operations\"&gt;Operation Andromeda&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Automatons reside in a slim corridor of space, flanked by the SEAF itching for a fight. They have tried to solve this issue and learn from their mistakes and instead of marching West to heavily defended positions, they have moved their attention East to sectors untouched by the war. Their attempts have proven futile as they are pushed into a small pathetic corner of Freedom hating space, their hour of judgement only delayed by the resilient plague that are and the unthinkable resurgence of the previously thought-to-be eradicated .\nHistory.\nOrigin of the Automatons.\nThe Origin of the Automatons are very vague, but thanks to a decrypted message from the announcing the \"Independence of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;\" and Cyborg entry into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, we know that the Automatons are descendants of the , created to continue fighting against &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; and one day liberate the Cyborgs from their unwarranted enslavement on Cyberstan.\nThe Automatons are entirely mechanical beings. They no longer require traitors from &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; or corpses of fallen Helldivers to create new troops. Automatons all have similar characteristics, such as dark metallic bodies, digitigrade legs, skull-like heads, armour plates, and a pair of red glowing eyes.\nIncursions into the Severin Sector.\nIn early 2184, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; outbreaks in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;, Automaton Forces made several incursions into the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; were captured first as well as &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt;. Only on February 8th would the first official footage of Automatons be released by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. Super Earth, now in a two front war, made the decision to mass mobilise the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; at a scale not seen since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. After the first phase of &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Valiant%20Enclosure\"&gt;Operation Valiant Enclosure&lt;/a&gt; was completed, the Automatons launched a surprise attack into several developed worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sectors&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Swift%20Disassembly\"&gt;Operation Swift Disassembly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; had had little activity during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Valiant%20Enclosure\"&gt;Operation Valiant Encloser&lt;/a&gt; with only minor engagements in the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;. After the conclusion of Operation Guardian on March 26th, interrogated bots started referencing an Automaton plan called \"The Reclamation\". In response to this news, S.E.A.F. High Command issued Operation Swift Disassembly, a massive multiphase offensive to rid the galaxy of the Automaton Legion. The first phase was to disrupt communications by decommissioning a long-range communication array built by the Automatons on &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; immediately deployed to &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; to break the line and reach Troost. Ustotu was liberated within a day of the order being given, and the Helldivers continued their momentum onto &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;, which would be freed not long after. Troost would be liberated on March 29th and the long-range communication array would be decommissioned. After Troost's liberation it was discovered that the long-range communication array was transmitting outside the Galactic Frontier to something out of sight. \nPhase 2 of the Operation was focused on &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; and its significant producer of \"illegal Automaton combatants\". Helldivers deployed to &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; to gain FTL access to Tibit, but this would be stopped in its tracks by an Automaton attack on &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt;, which threatened to jeopardise the entire operation. Faced with the threat of encirclement, the Helldivers created a plan to combat the Automatons' efforts. A majorty of Helldivers would deploy to Ubanea and complete its liberation while a skeleton crew would defend Draupnir long enough for Ubanea's liberation. This would later be known as the ill fated Ubanea Gambit. The Helldivers fought valiantly on both worlds, but it was not enough to sway the tide of battle. Draupnir would fall to the Automatons, cutting off access to Ubanea, and the Ubanea Gambit would be remembered as a tragedy by all Super Earth citizens. This would not deter the Helldivers, though, as &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; would be liberated followed by &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; whose liberation had not even reached zero yet. With only hours left on the order, Helldivers deployed onto Tibit in a last ditch attempt at success, but the efforts would be in vain as the order ultimately failed. \nWith this burden on the S.E.A.F.'s shoulders, High Command decided to lift morale by ordering the complete liberation of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, which had seen 60 days of constant fighting. Within mere hours of the order being issued, the Creek's liberation was finally achieved. The President of Super Earth issued a decree declaring that April 3rd shall become known as Malevelon Creek Memorial Day to remember the twenty five million Helldivers who gave their lives for the Creek. With morale as high as ever, High Command issued an order to defend the newly liberated territory. This was easily completed, even with a surprise attack on &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, on April 9th, 2184, the final phase of Operation Swift Disassembly was issued: all worlds controlled by the Automaton Legion were to be liberated in an all out offensive to rid the galaxy of them and finally end the war.\nFirst to return to liberty's arms was &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; was finally liberated, avenging the Ubanea Gambit and now only &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; remained. ~350,000 Helldivers deployed at once to the planet's surface. The Legion's rein of terror was only hours away from annihilation, and by day's end, &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; was finally free. Two months of tyranny in the west had finally come to an end. Freedom reigned supreme as the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth Flag&lt;/a&gt; flew over the crumbling remains of the Automaton stronghold of Durgen. Now only the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Terminid front&lt;/a&gt; stood against freedom.\nThe Reclamation.\nAt 11:41 am SEST on April 9th, 2184, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;S.E.A.F.&lt;/a&gt; High Command delivered a High Priority Broadcast ordering all units to LIBCON 1 as a massive Automaton invasion fleet had FTL jumped to the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Within hours the entire Valdis Sector was under the Legion's control. The S.E.A.F. was in crisis, and all Helldivers were ordered to the defense immediately. Within a day, the Automatons had reached &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, within a stone's throw away from the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;. After four straight days of constant Automaton attacks, the line stablised, allowing for a small S.E.A.F. counteroffensive and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;. The Line only lasted for three days, though, as another massive Automaton offensive smashed through the S.E.A.F. line into the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;. With defeats mounting, the S.E.A.F. launched Operation Legitimate Undertaking, a massive attack into Automaton space. However, the operation was terminated after the failure of the Terminid Control System.\nNeglection of the Automaton Front and June \"counterattacks\".\nThrough out May all attention was on the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;. This left the bots unchecked for a long period of time, allowing them to spread into the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;. After the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, the S.E.A.F. turned all attention to the situation in the West, where a Data Centre codenamed Database One was discovered on &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, a planet recently invaded by the Automatons. After four days of fighting, Wasat was liberated, but &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; was taken by the Bots, which marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Ymir%20Encirclement\"&gt;Ymir Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. The captured database revealed plans for the terraforming of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, detailed records of the impact of the Terminid Supercolony, and keywords referring to \"Vessel 00\", \"Nucleus\" and \"The Final Collective\". Another offensive was launched towards &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wels&lt;/a&gt; where civilians were trapped. However, only Vernen Wells ended up being liberated. In late June, the bots began to make incursions into the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;. S.E.A.F. High Command issued &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Xzar%20Lockdown\"&gt;Operation Xzar Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, ordering the Helldivers to defend the Sector at all costs. At first, the Operation was successful, but the Bots put most of their focus in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt; instead, allowing for sweeping gains and eventually reaching to within two FTL lines of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. The losses in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt; were staggering, the entire Sector under the Socialist Automaton thumb. However, the Bots never tried invading the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt; again.\nJuly Campaigns and the Matar Bay Encirclement.\nOperation Starslayer.\nFollowing the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Xzar%20Lockdown\"&gt;Operation Xzar Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, the S.E.A.F. were focused on the Terminid Front. On July 3rd, the radiation levels on &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; were found to be at completely safe levels for S.E.A.F. operations. This prompted the S.E.A.F. forces to attempt the excavation and recovery of the Advanced Weapons Lab from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, as well as plans for an Interplanetary Battle Station. Unfortunately, the Automaton forces became aware of &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;'s importance to the SEAF and launched an all out attack on the planet. The Bots had two avenues of attack, one through &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; and another through &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Still, even while completely encircled, the S.E.A.F. forces in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt; stood strong, seeing the liberation of Meissa and several successful defences of &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;. During these skirmishes, however, S.E.A.F. Forces were unable to maintain control of Wezen and Vega Bay. \nUndaunted, the S.E.A.F. forces took this time to amass on &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;, preparing for a push through the Automaton lines into the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; to re-connect with the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Ymir%20Encirclement\"&gt;Ymir Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. Regrettably, an Automaton attack on the planet postponed these plans for an all out attack on the Automaton lines, and Aesir Pass fell to the Bots, leaving S.E.A.F. forces with little hope of establishing the strategically important connections that would have cut off the Automaton forces in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;. On July 9th, 2184, Operation Starslayer was declared a success, and the plans for the interplanetary battle station were recovered. Along with it, the plans for the &lt;a href=\"MLS-4X%20Commando\"&gt;MLS-4X Commando&lt;/a&gt; were also recovered and successfully shipped off-world for mass production, enabling its fleetwide deployment.\nOperation Andromeda and Righteous Expunge.\nAfter this, the S.E.A.F. started the first trial of the Terminid Research Initiative to test how to best kill a bug. After this, on July 11th, S.E.A.F. High Command issued Operation Andromeda, a massive attack into Automaton territory to cut them in half. The offensive as focused on the thinnest part of the line at &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. First, &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; was taken back after the disaster a week before, then Matar Bay. The only connection from the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; fell to the S.E.A.F. &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; was liberated on the 16th, finally re-connecting the forces trapped in the Ymir Sector to the rest of the galaxy after one month and six days. The last planet in the order was &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, which had not seen a single Helldiver since the ill-fated Martale Gambit in April, but now was the time to rectify those mistakes and avenge the fallen of Martale. The liberation of Martale marked the end of Operation Andromeda and the successful fracturing of the Automatons' Domain. The Automaton Forces after the Operation were in disarray, the S.E.A.F. saw an opportunity to liberate the territory lost to the Automatons in Operation Enduring Bulwark and fully liberate the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt; fell first then &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time as this, the Automatons from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; tried to reconnect with the trapped forces by attacking &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Only Aesir Pass would fall to the Bots. This distraction postponed efforts on &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; to an extent that the Helldivers were faced with Choepessa IV at 67% liberated with only 8 hours left on the Major Order. The Helldivers always succeed in their missions, though, and Choepessa IV was liberated with only minutes to spare.\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nThe Helldivers had turned their attention East to complete Operation Glorious Xenocide, a second Terminid Research Initiative, but on July 27th the Automatons started to deploy &lt;a href=\"Automaton%20Orbital%20Cannons\"&gt;Orbital Cannons&lt;/a&gt; to planets in the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. High Command ordered the destruction of these Orbital Cannons and the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;. All planets except &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; were liberated during the operation. Fortunately, Wezen would be liberated two days after the end of the operation. Only &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; remained in the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;, the final strongholds that the machines refused to give up, even creating new units solely dedicated to saving those planets from inevitable destruction.\nEscalation of Freedom.\nAfter the massive offensive that was Operation Liberty Crush, the Automatons had consolidated an iron stronghold around &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to construct new units to deploy onto the field to turn the tide of the war. &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; were still isolated by two Sectors of space from the nearest Automaton forces, allowing an easy win for the S.E.A.F. On August 10th, 2184, Operation Lighthouse was launched, calling for the Liberation of &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; and end of the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. On August 12th, Vandalon IV was liberated, and on August 14th, Troost was liberated as well, finally crushing the last remaining pockets of resistance in the Encirclement. Seeing the demise of their comrades on Troost, the main Automaton force invaded the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt; on August 11th. S.E.A.F. High Command issued Operation People's Shield, the liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The operation would end with a Super Earth Victory, but the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and continued occupation of the Sector says other wise. \nOperation Leap Forward and the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their defeat at Tarsh, the Automatons would begin refocusing their strength on other sectors in order to acquire needed materials for their projects. For this purpose, in the months of September to November 2184, the Automatons would take the war towards the Tanis and Talus Sectors, in search of metals required for the creation of a new task force. However, this campaign would quickly be rebuked by the Helldivers, as they managed to deny them of said minerals and mining facilities in the battles of &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt;. However, having gained a foothold at &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons would manage to scavenge metals and jet packs from fallen Helldivers and would create a new force: The Jet Brigade.\nThis brigade would be first assembled in &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; on October 13th, a long-time Automaton stronghold from the initial Reclamation, and would go on to temporarily reclaim &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; before they were defeated and dismantled at &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. However, this defeat would only worsen their resolve, as the Automatons had learned of the existence of Super Earth's newest weapons project: The &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;\nAcknowledging the risk that such a superweapon posed to their existence, the Automatons attempted to mount an offensive in order to pinpoint the Democracy Space Station and destroy it. However, shortly before they could mount their offensive, the Automatons lost their precious forward base at the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, which nominally separated them from their tenures in the Tanis Sector, as now Vog-Sojoth had no means of reconnecting to the Automaton Supply lines.\nAfter collecting enough metals from throughout their fief, the Automatons assembled the Jet Brigade for a second time at Vernen Wells and, on November 10th, invaded and captured Tarsh once more, destroying the DSS Logistics Hub and learning of the location of the DSS. Then, on November 11th, the Automatons captured Mastia after 48 hours of continuous combat. Then finally, on November 12th, the Automatons took advantage of the chaos created by a disaster at the &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Terminid Research Preserve on Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; and launched an assault onto &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;. The Jet Brigade would fight hard, posing a formidable challenge. Yet, their struggles would be rendered futile when, at 21:37 SEST - EST, the Democracy Space Station would be successfully activated after receiving a starting infusion of E-710 harvested by the Helldivers.\nWhile the bots managed to capture Gaellivare, they had been dealt devastating losses throughout their campaign and now had to contend with Super Earth's second strongest weapon after General Brasch. The Democracy Space Station rained planetary bombardments on their forces at Mastia and sent armies of Eagle Storms on them at Gaellivare. The Jet Brigade would manage to escape to Imber, only to be left entrapped as the Helldivers liberated Gaellivare.\nOn November 20th, the Helldivers would effectively expunge the Jet Brigade off the galaxy for a second time, ending the Automaton advance once more.\nFactions.\nAutomatons.\nThe are robots that were created by the from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, they are the only factions in the Automaton Legion. They are known to spread havoc and destruction in their wake, purging freedom wherever they go.\nIron Fleet.\nThe Iron Fleet is a leaked sub-faction of the Automatons. They are the Legion's enhanced strike forces, being made of titanium, that are predicted to be the strongest Automaton forces in the Galaxy, even more so than the waves on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. During Operation Titanium Belt, the Automatons had made an offensive into the &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sectors&lt;/a&gt;, trying to reach the large titanium repository on &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe attacks were repelled by the Helldivers with minimal territorial losses and most importantly of all, the Automaton limited-use strike forces were denied the critical resources for its construction. The Automaton decided to move efforts for the limited use-strike force to &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; where they began deep-mantle mining operations on the planet to use extreme heat and pressure near the planet's core to create an extremely strong and ductile chromium-cobalt-nickel alloy to construct the armour of the Iron Fleet. These operation were crushed in Operation Freedom's Forge when Super Earth liberated the planet and took over the mines for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, However the Automatons launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; to try and retake the mines and create the Iron Fleet but were repelled destroying any chance of the creation of the Iron Fleet. \nJet Brigade.\nThe Jet Brigade is a division of the Iron Fleet consisting of Automatons with stolen Jetpack technology. Automatons with Jetpacks have been a part of Automaton infantry since the beginning but have been slowly dialed back since until they were basically nonexistent, only to reappear in mass on October 18th, 2184. They were built in secret for a long time, with the Automaton's search for titanium likely relating to them. However the materials to build the Jet Brigade could not have come from &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt;, as both had ended in failure for the Legion. However, based on more recent field reports, the Automatons are salvaging Super Earth equipment, meaning the Jet Brigade could have been built with these salvaged materials.\nAlong with the building of the Jet Brigade in secret, it is feared that the Automatons may have also come to know of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;DSS&lt;/a&gt; due to their cyberattacks on the DSS Logistics Hub at &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;. While it is unlikely that the Automatons know where the DSS is, the Automatons may try to brute force the location of the Democracy Space Station from the databanks of the Logistic hub in a similar manner that Super Earth cracked &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Database One&lt;/a&gt;. If true, this would explain the first deployment of the Jet Brigade from &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; on October 18th, and then to &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; on the 20th.\nThe brigade is coated in a visible chrome plating and sport big, bulky jet packs, reverse-engineered from those they managed to capture from fallen Helldivers. As of October 18th, the only brigade is the Jet Brigade with the rest of the Iron Fleet either not being produced or still being built in secret. Altough it required every drop of blood, oil, and E-710 that the Helldiver Corps had, the Jet Brigade would finally be defeated on October 22nd on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; by the narrowest of margins. Even so, the Jet Brigade remains a significant, albeit diminished, threat. We must remain ever-vigilant against future attacks. But for now, Liberty has won a great victory.\nFollowing the Liberation of &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and its high-security database during Operation Adamant Resolve, the Jet Brigade's staging ground and central fabrication planet was discovered. Whilst decrypting the intel, however, troubling evidence came to light: the Jet Brigade had swiftly recovered from their recent defeat by the Helldivers.\nThe main differentiator between the Jet Brigade and regular Automatons is their heavy use of jetpacks, unique chrome finish, and their Commanders, which are variants of the Marauder equipped with machine guns instead of laser pistols. While they are fragile, with their bulky backpack exploding after a well placed shot and having the same amount of armor as the &lt;a href=\"Trooper\"&gt;Troopers&lt;/a&gt;, they are still very dangerous. Reports from the field indicate they are able to gun down &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;S.E.A.F.&lt;/a&gt; and Helldivers with a handful of shots and are impervious to suppressive fire while also capable of calling for reinforcements.\nTactics.\nBattling Automatons requires Helldivers to adopt a drastically different approach compared to battling the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than relying on melee tactics like their bug-like counterparts, they are instead equipped with a vast array of projectile weaponry. Thus, Helldivers need to find a good balance between offense and defense, seeking cover whenever possible and focusing on rapidly disassembling the Automaton's heavy hitters before they can unleash their devastating attacks.\nWhile many Automaton models are well armored, their general humanoid structures possess a very notable weakness in their heads. Precise shots to the head, even on heavier enemies like &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Devastators&lt;/a&gt;, can concuss and destroy them with ease. Larger enemies have vents, generally located on their back. They can be preferable to other weak points due to their larger area and bright orange glow, making them easier to hit when your foe is facing away from you. \nAutomatons can be rapidly deployed in large numbers via &lt;a href=\"Dropship\"&gt;Dropships&lt;/a&gt;, which are called in with signal flares by the &lt;a href=\"Trooper\"&gt;general infantry&lt;/a&gt; units when alerted of a Helldiver's presence. If reinforcements are called, Helldivers can disrupt their deployment by shooting the dropship's thruster with heavy anti-armor weapon such as the &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"EAT-17%20Expendable%20Anti-Tank\"&gt;Expendable Anti-Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;Quasar Cannon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"APW-1%20Anti-Materiel%20Rifle\"&gt;Anti-Materiel Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that this may not kill or even damage all of the bots on board the dropship. All Helldivers are therefore recommended to exercise caution near recently liberated Automaton dropships, and prioritize bringing down dropships with smaller automaton units more likely to be killed by the explosion, or ships that will fall and crush more bots below if shot down.\nAutomatons can also be produced at outposts and &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;objective areas&lt;/a&gt; via Fabricators set up in said locations. Destroying the Fabricators can be done in a similar fashion to demolishing bug hives, by serving a fresh hot cup of liber-tea in the form of a grenade down their exhaust vents, or simply leveling the entire area using Eagle strikes or orbital bombardments. Be warned that a Fabricator will explode rather violently when destroyed, so Helldivers are to keep their distances or stay close to the ground when making their deliveries.\nAutomaton Outposts are defended by a majority of Troopers patrolling and manning machine gun emplacements, along with a wide variety of larger units such as &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Strider\"&gt;Scout Striders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Devastators&lt;/a&gt;, while large outposts can even include &lt;a href=\"Hulk\"&gt;Hulks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Annihilator Tanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Strider\"&gt;Factory Striders&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it's advised to approach heavy outposts utilizing stealth as much as possible before delivering as much simultaneous and overwhelming democratic force as possible. On higher difficulties, outposts may be guarded by &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Tower\"&gt;Cannon Towers&lt;/a&gt; which are only vulnerable from behind, and largely brush off small-arms fire.\nAutomaton \"Language\".\nScribbled onto certain structures, such as the Gunship Fabricator, it can be easily noticed that the Automatons utilize their own language in order to avoid monitoring by the Ministry of Intelligence while still coordinating their attacks onto the federation.\nAfter some months of training, SEAF Super Earth Special Forces (SESF) Cryptologists have managed to decipher most of the alphabet utilized by the devious machines.\nIt appears the Automatons have hijacked an ancient language of Super Earth known as \"Swedish\" and have adapted it into their own alphabet in order to deceive Super Earth surveillance. Whether this also applies to their \"spoken\" language isn't clear, if their bursts of binary static can even be considered speech to begin with. What is certain is that, much like Swedish, the Automaton language is written from top to bottom and is read from left to right.\nBesides this hijacked, fabricated language, the Automatons utilize standard terrestrial binary for their military communications, since the Automatons are unfeeling machines which rely on a computer to think."}

For one reason or another, it was spared the horrors of the First Galactic War, since it does not appear in any records for the Gellert Sector, meaning that this planet probably wasn't able to be colonized until the end of the First Galactic War allowed Super Earth to attain the technology necessary to settle this planet.\nAs such, Blistica spent much of its time during the Second Galactic War forgotten by the light of Super Earth, as its remoteness and apparently lack of resources simply didn't merit the Federation's attention. But this relative freedom was also something that attracted the envy of the Federation's enemies.\nAfter the fall of Cyberstan in April 2184, the Gellert Sector had cut off what little FTL connections it had, leaving it essentially insulated from the war, with what little colonists remained being completely unaware of the ongoing chaos and bloodshed.\nHowever, this peace would be shattered without warning when, on October 28th, 2184, the Automatons mounted an offensive into the Gellert Sector, restablishing the downed FTL Supply lines from Yed Prior and &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt; into both this planet and its neighbor Mintoria. Due to the then-Major Order asking the Helldivers to liberate &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, coupled with efforts to liberate &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; in the Terminid front, very few Helldivers would join the defense of either Mintoria or Blistica, and the Automatons easily captured both planets by the next day. Since then, no liberation attempts have been made at either of the planets, with both remaining under the iron grip of the robots ever since.\nOn November 25th, 2184, &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt; would be attacked by the Automatons, and due to the Helldivers not prioritizing the planet's defense, it would fall 2 days later, which fully locked away access to both Blistica and &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt;, ending their liberation campaign and locking them fully in the hands of the despotic socialist Automatons.\nOperation Crop Dust.\nOn December 5th, 2184, orders were given to liberate Blistica, along with &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt; as-well as &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are locked behind enemy lines. Such mentioned planets have been identified as being rich in salt-mines, which is needed in order to rectify the shortage of chlorine and finally commence the production of MD-8 Gas Mines and its requisition to all Super Destroyers. However, like Mintoria, all of Blistica's supply lines lead to Automaton space, and &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt; had to be liberated first in order to restart Blistica's liberation campaign and allow for its liberation. Following Zzaniah's liberation, the Automaton forces in the Gellert Sector had been sent on the run and what little had been left behind would concentrate on Blistica, preventing early liberation efforts from seeing much success.\nThese early delays, combined with the Helldiver Corps' focus on planets like Esker and Mintoria made it so that, by the time the main fleet finally reached Blistica, they would be unable to make progress towards its liberation in time to meet the operation deadline. While Operation Crop Dust failed, Blistica was still liberated by December 10th, successfully quashing the last remnants of the Automatons in the Gellert Sector."}

This planet resides on the southern border with only one current FTL lines to the nearby planet of &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nA veritable green maze, Bore Rock flora is dense and everpresent. Planet features frequent but small elevation changes from rocky hills into waterlogged channels and reservoirs. Helldivers should exercise caution, as the waters are treacherous. What from distance may look like ankle deep water, is in reality a very deep lake that one can very easy drown in mere seconds after stepping off from the shoreline. The planet is also dotted in ancient fossilized trees, some reaching far above the current tree line. Massive amounts of trees block sight, but due to sheer amount of them, they can be use as reliable cover.\nThis planet features a network of gas vents, located randomly throughout the surface. Yellowish in color and emiting a green smoke, any kind of fire or bullet ignites it, causing a fiery explosion in their proximity.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Falstaff &amp; Jin Xi Lockdown.\nHelldivers would set foot on Bore Rock for the first time during Operation &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; Lockdown, an operation in which many planets within the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; sectors would experience sudden Terminid outbreaks arising from previous operations.\nBore Rock would be defended in two occasions on June 2184 without much incident occuring.\nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nDuring Operation Glorious Xenocide, the Terminids at Esker would launch a third assault at Bore Rock, this time succeeding due to the Helldivers' prioritization of other liberation campaigns and their focus on culling as many Terminids as possible.\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation.\nAfter its fall on July 25th, Bore Rock would remain under Terminid control, mainly due to its isolation during that time since its only FTL Line was the one with Esker. However, Bore Rock's salvation would come from an unlikely source: &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;, a neighboring planet in its sector which, up until August 6th, had isolated itself and cut all of its supply lines. However, once its SEAF Outer Reconnaisance Outposts were overrun and the distress beacons began to cite new Terminid strains, Super Earth immediately issued a Major Order calling for not just Socorro's defense, but for the establishment of a quarantine zone on both Esker and Bore Rock, which marked the planet for liberation.\nBore Rock would be liberated on August 10th, with pretty much no resistance from the Terminids, as they had been isolated away from the rest of the Terminid broods much like Bore Rock had been cut away from the FTL Network before.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nFollowing its final liberation in August, Bore Rock has remained under Super Earth control without much incident, as the Gloom would make the war shift south towards the Jin Xi Sector. During this time, Bore Rock would establish new FTL Lines with Erata Prime and Terrek, finally ending its dangerous reliance on Esker.\nHowever, Bore Rock wouldn't be completely safe as, on November 6th, the Terminids would launch a triple attack aiming to conquer it, alongside &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and Esker. Since the operation's focus was the protection of Terrek, Cirrus and Angel's Venture, Heeth would be defended first. Then, with Bore Rock's immediate connection to Terrek at stake, the Helldivers would turn up in massive numbers to aid in the defense of the planet.\nHowever, it would be attacked one final time on November 8th, shortly after the victory at Crimsica. With this miscalculated blunder, the Helldivers would concentrate their forces on Bore Rock, the Terminids increasing their numbers soon after. For 20 hours, the battle carried on throughout the swamps and marshes of the planet as the Helldivers gave everything they had in order to drive the Terminids back into the Gloom. By November 9th, the assault had been repelled and the Terminids had been decisively defeated, their hatcheries collapsing and reducing the resistance levels of nearby planets.\nOperation Jetclipper.\nBore Rock would remain free of any attacks after November 9th, giving its colonists some respite. However, this freedom would be very shortlived as the Helldivers would be ordered away from the Falstaff sector in order to conduct an offensive against the Automatons. With their guard low, the Terminids launched an assault onto Bore Rock on November 28th. The Colonial Defenders would hold their ground, with small Helldiver contingents providing sporadic support. However, the defenses eventually cracked and Bore Rock would fall to the Terminids on November 30th.\nOperation Crop Dust.\nOn December 5th, 2184, Operation Crop Dust was ordered to all Helldivers. MD-8 Gas Mines needed chlorine, for which an odd disappearance of colonial labor had severely hindered the supply of, bottlenecking the production of the stratagem. In order to rectify that shortage, the Helldivers were ordered to liberate 3 planets identified to be rich in salt-- one of those being &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, which was inaccessible due to the fall of Bore Rock 5 days earlier. In order to access Esker, the Helldivers needed to liberate Bore Rock. The fight ensued for the next day, with moderate resistance, and on December 7th, 2184, every bug nest was eradicated and Super Earth declared victory over Bore Rock, the light of liberty now embracing the swampy planet once more.\nOperation Wormhole Spaguetti.\nBore Rock would spend the following weeks recovering from its time under Terminid control. However, before long, they would be plunged right back into the heat of the conflict on December 23rd, as the Terminids that had captured Esker immediately went on to attack Bore Rock. However, this move would be poorly timed, as the Helldivers had just finished securing Erata Prime and &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;, the 2 targets of the ongoing major order."}

On December 12th, it was the first planet to be attacked by The in the Second Galactic War as well as the first planet upon which they tasted defeat for the first time in a century.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, being a primarily arid and rocky world with an environment that has driven the flora and fauna to become extremely water efficient.\nA long time colony of the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, Calypso is a highly developed colony by the standards of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt;, with urban centers both large and small being found across much the planets surface. Unfortunately this large population has just meant more citizens for the cursed to take freedoms away from, transfiguring them into little more than cannon fodder in the Squ'ith war machine.\nCalypso's pre-invasion invasion cities were a mixed sprawl of suburban housing developments and mixed-use buildings. Helldivers deployed to Calypso quickly learned that urban warfare is very different from conventional combat in the open which they are used to out on the sparsely developed &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; fronts. A battle which was not only up close, but also much more personal.\nTight streets, visibility-obstructing buildings, Illuminate lightning traps, and variations in height advantage are just some of the perils Helldivers faced against the Illuminate invasion. Many a helldiver have run down an alleyway to escape a &lt;a href=\"harvester\"&gt;harvester&lt;/a&gt; only to run headlong into a horde of &lt;a href=\"voteless\"&gt;voteless&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, whilst the steel an concrete constructions that made up Calypsos' buildings could be knocked down with sufficient ordinance (or direct impact from a ) even a bomb-shattered ruin could pose a major obstacle for either side. Fortunately Calypso's cities also possessed many &lt;a href=\"SEAF\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt; facilities, including &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;Artillery emplacements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20SAM%20Site\"&gt;SAM Sites&lt;/a&gt; which proved devastating for the illuminate &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Ship\"&gt;Warp ships&lt;/a&gt;. Each city also possessed significant stockpiles of ammunition, medical supplies and weapon caches, which proved to be a major boon for the SEAF defenders.\nIn stark contrast to the urban sprawl, the terrain beyond Calypso's walled Cities is a mostly arid frontier, consisting of massive dust dunes and rocky canyons that shelter thorny shrubs -- breaking up the otherwise bleak and lifeless wasteland. Shrouded in endless dawn and dust, red sands cake every inch of this untamed land, with dust constantly whirling in the air causing constant visibility issues. Compounding this is the planets rotation, which makes a proper day-night cycle is near impossible. Combined with the dust, skies are often either shrouded in hues of red and orange, while what little daylight does reach the surface reveals the copper oxidization taking hold in the sky as it turns a tealish-green -- creating an aurora borealis effect.\nNotably in depressions in the ground there can be found pools of steaming and filthy ground water creating expansive mud marshes that slow movement considerably. It should be noted however that neither the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt; have clarified yet whether these pools are created by naturally occurring springs being fed by natural underground springs or industrial runoff from nearby cities. In addition to the above mentioned points, the planet also suffers from considerable geological instability.\nFrequent continental shifts results in frequent tremors that can cause entire regions to shake anywhere from several seconds to almost a minute, causing dust to be hurled into the air after the brief periods it is allowed to settle. As a result, most buildings have been reinforced to handle these frequent earthquakes and locals are generally used to such quavers from their home planet. However it has been noted by many Helldivers that being robbed of higher thought by the Squ'ith has done a number on the ability of the &lt;a href=\"Voteless\"&gt;Voteless&lt;/a&gt; to balance themselves, locking them in place when these tremors hit... usually.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nReturn of the Illuminate.\nCalypso was a peaceful planet colony in the Saleria Sector much like its neighbors, having been settled at some point after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a highly developed urban world. Additionally thanks to the planet's distance from both the eastern and western fringes, Calypso would avoid the worst of the second galactic war, at least for most of the first year of active fighting at least.\nDuring November of 2184, rumors from the frontier filtered back to Super Earth that colonists were going missing. Although the loss of some brave frontiersmen to untamed local fauna, poisonous flora and rugged wilderness is to be expected on furthest frontiers, the sheer number of missing people was enough to grab the attention of the wider federation, with Strohmann News running a story on the disappearances. However these disappearances were quickly assumed to be because of adventurous comic books encouraging more reckless behavior -- an assumption that would cost the federation, humanity and most of all managed democracy dearly.\nCalypso's peace would come to a bloody end when a foe long thought defeated revealed themselves to the galactic stage. On December 12th, an event long thought completely impossible occurred.\nThe , a race of sapient cephalopod humanoids that had once defied Super Earth during the First Galactic War and been banished from the Milky Way after their defeat, revealed themselves to have to have returned to the galaxy. Though how and why they have returned is not currently known, what is clear is that they intend to wage war on humanity once more.\nThe ongoing Operation Bughammer would be immediately aborted by High Command, as LIBCON 1 was issued to all available members of &lt;a href=\"SEAF\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver Corps&lt;/a&gt; -- all of whom were immediately directed to Calypso. Although the Helldiver's lacked the support of the DSS thanks to suspected sabotage, over 100,000 Helldiver &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; transferred immediately to Calypso and began deployment onto its urbanized areas, with the number rising as high as 170,000 throughout the day. With valiant courage, they put down the hordes of &lt;a href=\"Voteless\"&gt;Voteless&lt;/a&gt; citizens that the odious aliens had abducted out of their undemocratic misery and stared down the waves of &lt;a href=\"Overseer\"&gt;Overseers&lt;/a&gt; and Walking &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, even in the face of their Obliteration beams.\nHowever despite having the largest force assembled by the Super Earth Armed Forces since the final liberation of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; behind them, the enemy numbers and strength were far greater than any seen thus far, with SEAF Analysts putting the strength and Defense Condition for the invading Squ'ith fleet at around level 96 -- the highest for any single invasion seen to date, 38 levels stronger than the previous largest invasion fleet, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons%23Jet%20Brigade\"&gt;Jet Brigade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; which was noted as a level 58 defense condition. Additionally, the majority of Helldivers in active service had been called up for and only participated in the Second Galactic War, meaning that most of them lacked experience against this old enemy.\nHowever as with many things: The Light of Liberty graced our Federation once more. Despite the lack of knowledge combating the Illuminate (as well as the servers of the GWW struggling to coordinate so many Helldivers on one planet) the over 150,000 active Helldivers present on Calypso were able to hold the planet against all odds, with exactly 8 minutes and 59 seconds to spare before &lt;a href=\"SEAF\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt; defenses collapsed entirely. This would be marked as one of the closest any planet has been saved before defense collapse in the war so far, with only the defense of &lt;a href=\"Achird%20III\"&gt;Achird III&lt;/a&gt; against the being a closer race with under 5 minutes left on the deadline.\nWith the resurgent Illuminate repelled by the Helldivers, order was quickly restored on Calypso and victory finally declared on the 16th of December, 2184. Super Earth High Command immediately launched an investigation and assessed that a small cell of the Illuminate forces survived their eradication at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, staying hidden until now. Recent Democratic activity may have made their discovery imminent, precipitating the recent attack.\nThe shocking invasion of Calypso left colonies in ruins. Thousands remain unaccounted for, with multiple units reporting human-like combatants on the battlefield, with investigations into these reports of '&lt;a href=\"voteless\"&gt;voteless&lt;/a&gt;' ongoing. Yet despite the audacity of this shocking and unprovoked assault, the Helldivers once again proved their unmatched martial prowess.\nWith the enemy retreating in defeat, SEAF recon units were dispatched to hunt down any remnants left behind in their retreat, with orders to eradicate them as soon as they are located. Whilst Helldiver Corps may have suffered over 38 million casualties during the 3 day long defense of Calypso -- for comparison, 27 million Helldivers were killed in 9 weeks on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; -- the illuminate would suffer much more with over three billion kills confirmed by SEAF. However it should be noted that the vast majority of these casualties are the mind controlled &lt;a href=\"voteless\"&gt;voteless&lt;/a&gt;, with actual Squ'ith casualties being around five million. Even so, it should also be remembered that this is still a high price to pay for a species on the verge of extinction."}

Officially, the Second Galactic War arrived to this planet on\nTopography.\nThe planet is covered in brown rocks and sand, stained yellow from the constant acidic environment. The skies are dense and dark and stained a teal color. Many mushroom shaped mountains and hilly structures cover the landscape, with rough flatter land in between. The lowlands are often filled with acid filled craters and terraced lakes. &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; should be aware of the threats posed by low visibility, acid rain, and potential drowning risks.\nThe Cavern of Death is a natural bottleneck on the northern eastern side of Charbel-VII, it sits in the lowlands section of the planet to the right side of a Major Automaton Command Bunker. It is infamous for its extremely high amount of deaths associated with its drastic change of combat. In the lowlands, the planet offers a dune-like topography with minimal visibility, often cloaking the Cavern of Death with a acidic haze which attributes to its high death count. \nThe Cavern of Death is less than a quarter mile in length, and about 8ft wide at its shortest point. Its walls from right to left stand almost 30 feet high. Many helldivers have succumbed to death within the Cavern, given the rapid change in combat conditions, as its drastic change to extreme CQB combat is not common for the planet as a whole. While it does have a secondary exit point directly east, its incline is incredibly steep, slowing down any attempt to escape.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan (April 2184).\nCharbal-VII was attacked by small automaton invasion force on early hours of April 22nd, 2184.

However, the Automatons, programmed to destroy Democracy and hate freedom, would prove incapable of appreciating their lifestyle.\nOn April 3rd, a mere 2 days after their righteous extermination after the victory at &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons returned with a massive fleet, larger than the one seen months before. From deep space, they would first take over the Valdis Sector and conquer Cyberstan, then would begin to slowly spread their filthy mechanized socialism all over the Western Galactic Rim, one planet at a time.\nWhile the Helldivers had managed to stop the Automaton advance at the &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; Line, the Automatons had decided to push southwest, towards the location of their previous occupations. After switfly capturing Matar Bay and Martale, the Automatons lunged at Charon Prime while the Helldivers, now split between the crisis produced by the failure of the TCS Towers and the Automaton invasions, were occupied defending other planets. Charon's colonial defenses put up an excellent fight, but would inevitably collapse to the robotic onslaught, allowing Charon Prime to be occupied and allowing the Automatons to spread towards the Trigon Sector through Choepessa IV and into Charball-VII, from where they'd later attempt a return into the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Andromeda.\nCharon Prime would remain occupied from May to July, with the Helldivers unable to help it and its colonists having to resist their socialist occupiers for months in order to avoid capture (and, almost assuredly, guaranteed execution). It seemed that all hope was lost but, as Liberty would have it, a chance would glimmer from the horizon.\nAfter a series of key victories at &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and the Xzar Sector, the Automatons' iron grip upon their odious fief, now spanning a vast expanse of planets from Vandalon IV to Merga IV, had revealed itself as a great weakness against the righteous, steadfast force that were the Helldivers, unshakeable in their convictions despite all the adversities they had faced so far. With this weakness fresh in the mind, Super Earth High Command would issue an order asking for the capture of &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Martale, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; and the recently fallen &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;, said planets being in a line formation that could split the bot forces in half, leaving all of their western domain disconnected and ripe for liberation.\nAfter successfully liberating Aesir Pass on the 14th, Matar Bay on the 15th and Marfark at the early hours of the 16th, Martale would be captured right before the midnight of July 17th, successfully severing the Automaton Forces in half, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; Sectors completely disconnected from Cyberstan, which would cripple the garrisons in all of their planets, leaving them unable to reverse any progress done towards their liberation.\nOperation Righteous Expunge.\nThe campaign to liberate Charon Prime began immediately after the liberation of Martale and, shortly after, Super Earth High Command would issue a major order for its liberation, alongside with Choepessa IV and Charbal-VII. On the midnight of July 18th, Charon Prime would be liberated."}

However, geological and historical record indicates that the climate of this world was not always so bleak and that one hundred years ago during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, Choepessa IV was a lush jungle world covered in vibrant vegetation and large bodies of liquid water.\nDuring the first war, the planet was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to the valiant efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; the planet was not only liberated but also blessed with large deposits of element E-710 which can still be found buried under its surface to this day.\nHowever in the century between the first Galactic War and the second, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; has noted a rapid shift in the planet's climate from tropical humidity to sub arctic. This has been caused by a chain reaction of positive feedback triggered by periodic changes in the planets orbit around the systems star, and the occlusion of the sun for a lunar cycle due to debris from orbital bombardment, which has rapidly changed the planets climate. Less sunlight reaches the northern latitudes. Temperatures dropped and more water froze into ice, expanding the polar glaciers which reflected more sunlight and cooled the planet even further. The whole planet \u2014 including it's oceans \u2014 froze over, killing off 98.7% of native plant and animal life.\nIn layman's terms, Choepessa IV is going through a completely natural ice age, one which is totally unrelated to resource extraction and manufacturing operations by the human colonies on the planet, and aforementioned lunar cycle without direct sunlight, naturally.\nHistory.\nFirst Galactic War.\nLiberation of Choepessa IV.\nNot much is known about Choepessa IV during the First Galactic War. It used to be a planet with tropical jungles, volcanoes and large bodies of water and, inevitably, the Bugs would spread to it and overrun it, leaving massive deposits of E-710 underneath its surface that, once the Helldivers had contained the Bug outbreak, would be exploited by Super Earth Colonists. However, in the years after the conflict in 2084, Choepessa IV's orbit around its eponymous sun began to change, which led to a quick shift from a tropical climate to a permanent sub-arctic one, which triggered a glaciation and froze over virtually all organic life on the planet, leaving it a snowy, barren wasteland.\nAccording to the description of the \"Purifying Eclipse\" cape, so much orbital ordnance was used on during the liberation of the planet that the resulting cloud of debris and ash would occlude its sun for an entire lunar cycle (around a super-month). No doubt this heavy bombardment that caused the planet's orbit to shift, as well as turn the once lush jungle world covered in vibrant vegetation into a frozen boneyard that few now tread.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Reclamation of Cyberstan.\nChoepessa IV had remained a peaceful planet for more than 100 years, even as neighboring planets such as &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; had fallien prey to the initial Automaton Expeditions. However, peace was not to last. Shortly after Operation Swift Disassembly concluded, a large Automaton Fleet conquered Cyberstan and the rest of the Valdis Sector, reigniting the conflict on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. The SEAF scrambled as planets fell to the robotic tide, with Choepessa falling shortly after the Menkent Line had been established.\nWhile it had not yet been lost, mostly thanks to the combined efforts by the Helldivers and the remaining Colonial Defenses, Choepessa IV would become stuck in an asymmetric, low-intensity liberation campaign, as the Helldivers have had to constantly divert resources and attention away from it, and from the Automaton Front at large.\nOperation Emancipator.\nShortly after, Choepessa IV would be a launching pad for the Automatons' attempt at reclaiming their old position, as from it, they would launch an assault into Varylia 5, then onto Ustotu and the rest of the Trigon Sector. While the fall of the Trigon Sector was unable to be prevented, the Helldivers managed to secure the Petafactory in Varilya 5, temporarily preventing the complete takeover of the sector.\nOperation Valiant Resistance.\nThe victory at Varylia 5 would then launch the Helldivers onto another victory at nearby Wasat. However, while they were occupied with the retrieval of Database One, the bot garrison on Choepessa IV sent a second assault onto Varylia 5, which would be held off successfully. Then, as the Helldivers returned to their rearguard at &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; to heroically rescue trapped children, the Automatons then launched a third assault that would succeed due to the lack of proper defenses.\nFrom here, the Automatons would reinforce their garrison at Ustotu and take over &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;, completing their odious settlement of the Trigon Sector, as now they had very much secured Vandalon IV. \nOperation Righteous Expunge.\nChoepessa IV would remain behind the southern Automaton Vanguard safely from June to Mid July 2184, when the Helldivers would successfully capture &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;; which sat right in the middle of a defensive line of planets going from &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;, the former being a fortified Super Earth forward base and the latter having been secured alongside &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Starslayer. This strategic victory would instantly send all of the Automaton garrisons in the Ymir, Trigon and Andromeda into disarray, rendering them unable to defend themselves against the righteous Helldivers.\nSuper Earth High Command, with time running out and with the momentum behind them, issued a major order for the liberation of Choepessa IV, alongside with Charbal-VII and Charon Prime. The first planet to be liberated was Charon Prime. Then, Charbal-VII followed. And finally, on July 21, with few hours to spare, Choepessa IV would be liberated, allowing for further liberation throughout the encirclement area."}

The planet's fall opened up FTL lanes to &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;, making it's loss all that much harder to bare.\nOperation Legitimate Undertaking.\nYet despite the Automaton's unjust and brutal occupation, the loyalty and bravery of Super Earth's surviving citizens shined through. Despite being trapped on Choohe, they were able to test a new Fortification System, vital to the survival of the federation: &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt;. These mines are designed to destroy heavily armored vehicles such as walkers and &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt;, something desperately needed halt the Automaton's armored spearhead. However with Automaton's closing in on the last survivor enclaves of both Choohe and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;, time is running out for surviving personnel and equipment for both planets.\n&lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; would be liberated first, securing it's stores of caustic chemicals and experimental air-burst rocket launchers. Unfortunately the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;, in their calculated oppression and hardwired avarice, have stymied our valient efforts to liberate &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt;. The loss of the indispensable explosives on the planet will mean significant delays to the production of Anti-Tank Mines. The explosive technicians on &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; have almost certainly been torn to pieces by the vicious blades of the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. All will agree that every possible resource was directed towards their salvation. Their sacrifice is hereby honored.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Jet Brigade.\nChoohe would remain under Automaton occupation ever since its failed liberation in April, as the robots used its location to pivot westward, flanking the Menkent line and managing to expand all the way to &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; before being split in two and severely defeated during Operation Andromeda in July 2184. With this operation, Choohe would find itself back on the frontlines of combat. However, its months under Automaton occupation had rendered it into a horrid foundry of mechanized tyranny, with the Automatons having heavily fortified the planet, which made it very difficult to liberate it.\nHowever, this foundry of terror would not show its nefarious tricks until October when the Automatons unleashed their new abominations onto the galaxy: The Jet Brigade, a hideous metallic chimera force made out of stolen SEAF jet packs and plundered metal from across their odious fiefs, welded together with the suffering of all the innocent, oppressed human colonists beneath their iron foot.\nThis horrendous enemy force would go on to violently reconquer Matar Bay and, after that, &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, killing many righteous Helldivers before they were finally stopped at the heroic defense at &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; on October 22nd.\nOperation Jetclipper.\nFollowing the apparition of the Jet Brigade, Choohe remained a target of interest for Super Earth Tactical Command, as many in the Helldiver Corps believed that Choohe, being the staging ground from where the Jet Brigade first appeared, was directly linked to the factories at which the Jet Brigade units were being assembled by the socialists.\nFollowing this hunch, Super Earth High Command would take a bold risk and issued a major order, tasking the Helldivers with liberating Choohe and killing 150,000,000 Automatons, as they believed that there could be intel hidden in any of the CPUs of any Automaton, meaning that it was statistically probable that they would find clues regarding the Jet Brigade's factories once they managed to find this figurative needle in the robotic hay stack.\nHowever, things would soon take an interesting turn as, within a day of Choohe capturing Matar Bay and, therefore, preventing any access to the SEAF, the Helldivers voted Choohe as the next DSS Target Planet, upon which it would cast an Orbital Blockade, marking the first instance in which the DSS was not accompanied by the Helldiver Corps.\nThe only company that the DSS would get would be a stranded Helldiver force of 629 Super Destroyers. While their efforts would not accomplish much progress towards Choohe's liberation, their bravery in the face of insurmountable odds is nothing but exemplary of the ways of Super Earth.\nThe DSS would leave Choohe, going back to Matar Bay to help with liberation efforts.\nThe real fighting would begin on December 2nd, after Matar Bay was liberated. The Helldivers would deploy en masse, deploying up to 63% of the entire corps at the time, with up to 26,000 Super Destroyers in orbit. Despite this, progress on Choohe was slow, for it had been severely reinforced by the Automatons during the many months it spent under their occupation. Combined with rogue platoons of Helldivers diverting towards other, non-essential planets, the campaign for Choohe looked increasingly grim as time wore on.\nOperation Jetclipper would be regarded as a failure, as Choohe was only at 85% liberated at the deadline's expiration. With the Major Order over, Helldivers would slowly redeploy to other planets, until a Terminid attack on &lt;a href=\"Terrek\"&gt;Terrek&lt;/a&gt; on late afternoon on December 4th, drained the remaining forces for defense. According to Ministry of Defense statistics, Liberation of Choohe was abandoned at around 90%, as remaining garrison was not able to stop the automaton counterattack. Yet there remains a slither of hope still, as Helldivers begun massive in between action of communicating the importance of finishing the proper campaign.\nHowever, despite the failure of operation Jetclipper, the Helldivers persisted on Choohe, managing to liberate it by the afternoon of December 5th, after the Automatons withdrew to Aurora Bay.\nFor the first time in several months, Choohe was free from the odious grip of the Automatons."}

It is the home of the Deep Mantle Forge Complex, a facility necessary for the production of the metal plates and other components needed for the construction of the Democracy Space Station\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;, old, rocky moon. Its topography is composed of a cratered, hilly landscape with occasional cliff formations. It is entirely grayscale, possessing little to no color other than non-natural structures. Its terrain, while hilly, is quite open, making it relatively easy to traverse. This also provides excellent long-distance visibility.\nClaorell is also home to extremely valuable mineral deposits underneath it's surface, which has attracted the attention of the Automaton's who've set up deep-mantle mining operations on the planet, creating a deep-mantle mining complex which has polluted the moons already thin atmosphere.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nClaorell was, up until September 2184, a peaceful lunar colony of Super Earth that relied on the export of many minerals valuable to the main industrial sectors of Super Earth. However, the Automatons, boundless in their greed, would not spare Claorell from the horrors of war in their quest to capture Imber's titanium deposits. On September 11th, after a couple tactical miscalculations by the Helldivers gave the Automatons control of &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; and Vog-Sojoth, the Automatons would make one final push towards Imber by sending a dual assault from the two previously mentioned planets, with Claorell being the second planet to be assaulted.\nThe Helldivers would be forced to leave Claorell to its own devices, as the Colonial Overseer scrambled to mount a defense with the weapons the planet already had and with the few Helldivers that did turn up for support. During the first 16 hours of the defense, the situation looked lost. But a spark of hope would glimmer in the horizon as the Helldivers, in a glorious display of democratic fervour, would crush the attack at Imber after just 14 hours then began to immediately redeploy onto Claorell, beginning to turn the situation around, with less that 4 hours remaining before the planet's defenses caved in.\nClaorell would be spared and the order would be won, successfully prebventing the Automatons from acquiring Imber's titanium deposits.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nFor a week, Claorell's colonists would be able to rest and recover, while the Helldivers were diverted back towards Tarsh and Mastia in order to secure important polystyrine deposits, which allowed for the fleetwide deployment of &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrages&lt;/a&gt;. However, shortly after, the Helldivers would be forced to draw a huge chunk of their available forces towards the Terminid front, due to difficulties faced at &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the Automatons at neighbouring Vog-Sojoth found an opportunity to easily cut off Helldiver access to their garrison and, on September 18th, sent dual attacks onto both Clasa and Claorell.\nDue to the logistical struggles related to the unusually resilient Terminid hives at Pandion, both Clasa and Claorell were overwhelmed by the incoming Automaton forces, as there weren't enough Helldivers to help repel them. Claorell would fall but, surprisingly, the bots would not occupy it, instead opting to concentrate their forces at Clasa in order to expand further into the Tanis Sector.\nAs such, the Helldivers spotted a unique opportunity to take back Claorell, seeing as it was left underdefended. It would be reliberated on September 22nd, shortly before the liberation of Trandor allowed for more manpower to be available.\nHowever, this would not be the last time Claorell would see action, as the Automatons immediately launched an attack onto Claorell during the night of September 23rd. This attack would prove successful, as the Helldivers would be unable to provide support due to a newly issued major order.\nOperation Leap Forward.\nDuring Operation Leap Forward, the Helldivers had to concentrate almost exclusively on the liberation of Gaellivare. This meant that the fall of Claorell was a sacrifice that had to be undertaken for the greater good. With Imber having fallen days prior, Claorell's defense collapsed and, subsequently, became completely unable to be liberated, as its supply lines all led to Automaton-controlled planets.\nOperation Freedom's Forge.\nFor the past several weeks, development of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; has proceeded on-schedule. However the next step to construct the powerful battle station is the establishment of the Deep Mantle Forge Complex. This Deep Mantle Forge will use extreme heat and pressure near a planet's core to create an extremely strong and ductile chronium-cobalt-nickel alloy. The powerful alloy will be required to withstand the acceleration of the immense DSS to warp speeds.\nSuper Earth was able to identify -- based on atmospheric readings -- that the Automatons were already engaged in deep-mantle mining operations on the moon of Claorell. Thus liberating their mining tunnels and repurposing their facilities became top priority, as it would greatly accelerate the construction of the Deep Mantle Forge. Further, it would deny the Automatons their own access to the high-cost mine network, and reveal insight into their larger intentions. Thus the Helldivers are directed to liberate Claorell and its deep-mantle mining complex from the Automatons.\nAfter 2 days of battling, Imber's defenses collapsed, allowing for its swift liberation, whichthen allowed the Helldivers to move onto Claorell with haste. With merely hours to spare, the Helldivers spared no bullet in liberating the barren moon, managing to liberate it on October 7th, mere hours before the Automatons managed to bring reinforcements onto the planet and securing the tunnel system for Super Earth's miners to build the Deep Mantle Forge Complex, which will allow for the creation of a brand new alloy that will permit the DSS to withstand FTL Warp Jumps.\nHowever, it was also discovered that the Automatons were also developing new alloys in these tunnels in order to create new types of armor plating. More on this development is being investigated by the Ministry of Intelligence.\nOperation Bulwark of Democracy.\nThe colonists at Claorell would have to come back right into the heat of the battle. Even after its peaceful and righteous liberation, the Automatons refused to concede and, as such, mounted an offensive with the intent of retaking Claorell and its deep space mining complexes. Fittingly, Super Earth High Command ordered for Claorell to be defended, as well as for the Helldivers to hold the line against the Automaton menace while the Deep Space Forge Complex was under construction.\nOn October 8th, the already tried and tested colonists of Claorell had to take on the role of miners and frontline soldiers, fighting shoulder to shoulder with both Colonial Defense soldiers and Helldivers alike, hurling super-dynamite at the mechanized Hulks and impaling the evil Devastators with their shovels.\nBy October 9th, Claorell had been defended against the Automatons, allowing the colonists to take a break and resume their democratic work while the Helldivers moved on to defend other planets from the robotic menace.\nIn the early hours of October 10th, Claorell was attacked again. However, once more, the Helldivers would mobilize en masse in order to defend what rightfully belonged to the citizens of Super Earth. After an entire day defending, the Helldivers would successfully repel the second attack onto Claorell with minimal casualties, while also dealing a heavy blow to the robotic offenders.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nClaorell would remain under Freedom's control ever since its last assault, its Deep Mantle Forge burning bright as it churned out batch after batch of chromium-cobalt-nickel (CCN) alloy plates as the Democracy Space Station began to undergo its construction, with the planet's economy seeing a massive boost and an influx of new colonists.\nHaving been denied of such wonderful prosperity, the Automatons began to scheme. Claorell was free itself, but its neighboring planets in the Tanis Sector were all still in bondage under the occupation of the socialist machines. As such, it was only a matter of time before the Automatons turned their eyes towards Claorell once more.\nOn October 28th, the Automatons began to expand further into the Tanis Sector, as well as into the neighboring Gellert Sector to the galactic north. However, once the Automatons were successfully repelled at &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, and then rebuked once again at Demiurg on November 1st. This left the Automatons with only one place left to go before they ran out of options to expand in the Tanis Sector, a planet that they had already failed to hold several times: Claorell.\nShortly after the successful defense at Demiurg, the Automatons at Clasa, using the remainder of their forces, would send out an attack at Claorell. Knowing that the loss of the Deep Mantle Forge Complex would delay the completion of the Democracy Space Station, the Helldivers immediately deviated the majority of the corps towards the defense of the planet, which would make the initial defensive operations much easier for the SEAF.\nAfter 16 hours of fighting, the Helldivers would successfully drive the Automatons off Claorell once more, keeping the Deep Mantle Forge Complex safe."}

However, unlike X-45, Clasa had managed to be colonized and settled some time after the First Galactic War, as well as remaining inhabitable and productive. However, the Automatons, in their hatred of Super Earth's capitalist might, could not stand such a simple existence, for their drive to pollute planets with socialism was embedded into their transistors.\nBy September 2184, the Tanis Sector had become a frontline region of the Automaton front, shortly after the Helldivers had decisively repelled the Automaton attacks against Imber. However, the Helldivers weren't sufficiently manned and the Terminids continued to spread their fascism, which led to the Helldivers having to constantly bounce between fronts. Amidst an unusually difficult liberation campaign on &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons at Vog-Sojoth decided to launch a dual attack and, on September 18th, launched assaults at both Clasa and Claorell, with the bulk of the Automaton forces falling at Clasa.\nAfter the fall of Clasa on September 19th, it became the new forward operations base for the robotic armies in the Tanis Sector, as its stood at an important chokepoint that cut off Zefia, Demiurg and Yed Prior from the rest of the FTL Network, making it a critical planet to control.\nYet, despite its critical location, the Helldivers have been continuously driven away from any serious liberation efforts on Clasa, mostly due to its remoteness and the constant surge of higher priority objectives.\nInterim (Sept. 19th-).\nSince the fall of Clasa in September, the swampy planet had fallen under full Automaton control. Between the months October to December, the heavily reinforced garrison at Clasa would go on to send assaults towards Zefia, Yed Prior, and Demiurg in the time ever since. While the Helldivers were able to repel the attack at Demiurg, they were unable to protect Zefia and Yed Prior from falling to the bots. In turn, the fall of the aforementioned planets would strike a disaster for the SEAF, as the Automatons would reestablish FTL lines between the Tanis Sector and its northern neighbor, the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The bots would mount an offensive into &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt;, before combining those forces into a sizable assault at &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt;. All 3 planets would fall under Automaton occupation and the bots' control over the Tanis and Gellert Sectors would become more and more inevitable by the day."}

Its only flora is the crimson red algae which covers most of its surface. It is devoid of trees or any other large flora. The surface is lightly covered in a medium-thick greenish-gray fog, which somewhat reduces visibility. It is also prone to sudden bursts of rainshowers.\nIts geography is mostly mountainous stretches of rocky terrain, with both small and large hilltops covered in boulders. While Crimsica does have oceans, they are uncommon and are often surrounded by large cliffs.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations prior to the Second Galactic War.\nOperation CBCT Protection.\nCrimsica, like neighboring &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Draco Sector, was largely unreachable by the SEAF until the successful installation of the Terminid Control System (TCS). Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Prime%20Liberation\"&gt;Operation Prime Liberation&lt;/a&gt;, Civilian Biomass Collection Teams (BCTs) were deployed to Crimsica to gather and process inert Terminids for research. The Helldivers were tasked with liberating the planet to protect them, which they did effortlessly.\nAfter the withdrawal of both BCTs and Helldivers, Crimsica fell back into the Terminids' claws. The planet became a low-priority target as SEAF personnel were shifted to other areas, defending against Terminid offensives on neighbouring Estanu and participating in Operation Swift Disassembly against &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors.\nOperation Rearing.\nOnce Operation Swift Disassembly concluded, Super Earth High Command took steps toward the provision of more efficient services, which required condtructing improved E-710 plants. Crimsica, alongside &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; and neighbouring Estanu, was selected as one of the recipients of these new farms.\nDespite the operation's success, the peace would not last. As the Automaton Invasion of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; reignited the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;, Crimsica continued to be assaulted by the fascistic insectoids. It was the site of much of the slaughter during Operation Organic Harvest, in which the Helldivers valiantly and mercilessly exterminated two billion Terminids in under 24 hours.\nDuring Operation Enduring Bulwark, Crimsica and neighboring Estanu saw the conducting of constant liberation and defensive operations. Despite the indescribable suffering and destruction caused by the Terminid menace, the colonists of Crimsica would not yield, not once faltering in the face of the mindless, ravenous insect hordes.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nAfter the unexpected failure of the TCS, the Draco System was sadly overwhelmed by the reinforced bug onslaught. After evacuating the surviving colonists, Super Earth was forced to withdraw from the Draco Sector, with Crimsica being lost to the fascist menace.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nCrimsica and the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; Sector remained under Terminid occupation through the month of May 2184, with the planet seeing serious damage to its environment.

On May 30th, the Helldivers would make use of a new superweapon in order to destroy the Terminid Supercolony: The Dark Fluid.\nImmediately after &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the Helldivers opened two fronts for a counterattack on the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors: One being a liberation campaign on &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, the other being simultaneous liberation efforts on both Crimsica and &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nAfter reestablishing freedom on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut&lt;/a&gt; Sector and some much needed victories on the Automaton Front, the Helldivers would receive a major order requiring the liberation of 5 planets: &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and Crimsica. Crimsica would be fortunate enough to be chosen as the first planet to be liberated from the fascist alien insectoids, with its liberation arriving on June 16th.\nFalstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nHowever, it would not last for long. Fori Prime, always rebellious and very resistant to Liberty, would fall sometime around June 28th and then, almost by instinct, would send a Terminid spore barrage right towards Crimsica, where it made landfall on June 29th. The Helldivers, focused on securing the neighboring sector of Jin Xi at the time, could not heed its calls for aid and, comprehensively, Crimsica would fall once more, remaining under Terminid control since.\nOperation Starslayer.\nDuring Operation Starslayer onwards, Crimsica would remain under Terminid control, causing further complications in the Terminid front. During the final week of June and the first 2 weeks of August, Crimsica's brood of Terminids would make repeated attempts to invade Acamar IV, none of them succeeding and, at a certain point, allowing the Helldivers to push back into Crimsica, getting it all the way up to 98% liberation before Operations Liberty Crush and Vengeful Cleansing ordered the Helldivers away, sparing the Terminids in Crimsica from obliteration at the last minute.\nOperation Prometheus.\nHowever, showing mercy to the fascistic insects would, as always, prove to be a grave mistake. When the Helldivers did an extraordinary display of mercy, the Bugs spat on Liberty's face and launched an assault onto Estanu on August 13th, now being bolstered by the malevolent &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, its putrid aura of intergalactic Terminid spores apparently giving them more fuel to the fire that is their innate hatred for Freedom. With the Automaton Front being in a more stable position and with &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; having been successfully rescued from the bugs, Super Earth High Command would issue a major order requesting the collection of 10 million Rare or Super Rare samples on Crimsica.\nHowever, as always, treason would spell doom for Crimsica. Not even 30 minutes into Operation Prometheus, traitors submitted a high number of counterfeit samples, provoking the abortion of the Operation and snatching Crimsica's chance for liberation out of its grip since now that the Helldivers didn't have any orders, they chose to divert towards the defense of Estanu, leaving Crimsica's liberation to lose all of its progress.\nOperation Brute Force.\nCrimsica would have to endure another 4 days of horros as, while the Helldivers were diverted towards &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;, they also had to help defend and repel Terminid attacks on other planets, which pretty much left Crimsica helpless. However, its chance for liberty would soon appear, as the Helldivers would be promptly turned back towards the Terminid Front in order to contain the ever-growing Gloom, which was now growing uncontrollably.\nOn August 22nd, Crimsica would be finally liberated from Terminid occupation, which helped prevent further Gloom expansion.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nCrimsica remained a stalwart frontier world against the Terminids ever since its liberation, being right at the edge of the Gloom in the Draco Sector yet experiencing an uneasy armed peace, as Fori Prime's unknown status still presented a threat to its safety. Its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, the site of a newly built Xenoentomology Center devoted to the creation of new Alcubierre Drives for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, and its direct FTL line to Acamar IV, which was designated to be the new Terminid Research Preserve, meant that Crimsica would be designated as a priority target for the Helldivers during Operation Ring of Freedom.\nCrimsica would be suddenly attacked from within the Gloom on October 16th, alongside Estanu. Given Crimsica's connection to Acamar IV, the Terminids would concentrate mostly on attempting to capture Crimsica, which meant that the Helldivers were forced to abandon Estanu to its own devices. Crimsica would be successfully defended on October 17th, after heavy casualties and 22 hours of fighting.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nWith Crimsica secured, the Terminid Research Preserve could continue its work unimpeded. However, this situation would not last long. Following the apparition of the Jet Brigade on the Automaton Front, Gacrux and Pandion-XXIV would fall, which left Acamar IV exposed to the Gloom's influence. However, the Helldivers would manage to plug this gap before any significant damages were made by the bugs.\nDespite this, the Terminids would redouble their efforts and, aided by a spore surge from within the Gloom, would launch a massive offensive onto the Barrier Planets. On November 7th, shortly after the fall of Esker, Crimsica would be assaulted alongside Estanu, the Terminids still determined to breach the Terminid Research Preserve.\nFor the first 18 hours of the assault, it looked like Crimsica had been abandoned to its own devices by the Helldivers, as the bugs made tremendous advances. However, once Estanu fell, the Helldivers began to relocate to Crimsica immediately as the Bugs had begun the final, slower phase of their assault. The defense was tense and chaotic, as the Helldivers rushed to take over crucial positions in Crimsica as quickly as possible, scuttling several Super Destroyers in the process in order for the crashing wrecks to take out as many of the fascist insectoids as possible.\nAfter 4 hours of intense orbital bombardments and on-the-ground combat, the Helldivers managed to miraculously repel the assault less than 30 minutes before the Terminids managed to reach the threshold of fascism necessary to take over Crimsica.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nCrimsica would remain free following its liberation, as the Terminids had been seemingly repelled and they made no additional attempts on Crimsica. However, beyond its sector's borders, Crimsica's perdition had been brewing all along.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nExpectedly, with the Helldivers focused on saving the critical research material at Turing, Crimsica would be lost to the Terminids by the afternoon of the following day, in a massive disaster that took millions of lives and undid all the progress achieved in the past 3 months.\nOperation Balance of Liberty.\nFollowing the disaster at Acamar IV, Crimsica was left to fall to the Terminid invasion, as the Helldivers had to return to the Automaton front in order to secure the DSS. For 9 days, Crimsica was stuck in a deadlock, as the Helldivers battled against the Terminids at Acamar IV and the Jet Brigade at &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;. It wouldn't be until the liberation of Imber on November 20th that the Helldivers would finally be able to resume containment missions back in the Terminid Front.\nGiven Crimsica's symbolic status within the Helldiver Corps as a twin planet to Estanu, the Helldivers would choose to deploy the main fleet and the Democracy Space Station on it first, even enacting an Orbital Blockade as an additional preventive measure. After 24 hours of grueling combat, Crimsica would be liberated once again."}

{"id": "5928", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5928", "title": "Curia", "text": "Curia is one of the five planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nCuria was a strategically important planet since April 2184. When the Automatons launched their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and began to push towards &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, Curia was part of the supply line connecting Super Earth to the Western Front via Aesir Pass. During the numerous times &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and occupied, Curia ensured supply access to the planet. With Aesir Pass haven fallen under Socialist occupation for several weeks by July, their forces were rapidly recovering from their previous &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;encirclement&lt;/a&gt; disaster. Curia was the only clear way forward in the backwards minds of the red pest.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nCuria had been, up until August 2184, a stalwart front against the Automaton offensive, always standing strong against the consistent incursions from the Automatons. For several months, its colonists watched as, time and again, the Automatons would reach Aesir Pass, only to be repelled. However, as the war took its toll on the Helldivers and they began to be diverted back to the Terminid front amidst the appearance of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons would put Curia through its hardest test yet.\nAs the Helldivers managed to rescue &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons, in a desperate attempt to rescue what little remained of their odious fief in the Trigon Sector, launched an assault on Curia on August 10th, punching through their defenses by the morning on August 11th.\nOperation People's Shield.\nCuria would not remain under the cruel grip of the Automatons for long. With Operation Prometheus being aborted due to counterfeit samples being delivered, Super Earth High Command would shift its focus towards the imminent Automaton threat that loomed on Curia. Deeming it intolerable for the robotic menace to advance any further, they would issue an order calling for the liberation of Curia while repelling any and all Automaton attacks. \nCuria's liberation became more desperate on August 17th, as the Automatons attempted a massive onslaught on Tarsh, with Curia as their point of attack. During the first day of Tarsh's defense, the situation seemed disfavorable, as the Automaton forces, now equipped with more advanced Scout Striders and Missile-Firing tanks, would begin to crack Tarsh's defense. However, the Helldivers spotted a crucial opportunity on Curia. With Curia close enough to full liberation for it to be done in under 24 hours, the Helldivers would strategically split in two, with one group holding the Automatons back in Tarsh while the other went for Curia in order to accomplish a masterful gambit strategy that paid in spades.\nOn August 18th, Curia would be liberated, cutting the assaulting bots in Tarsh off their supply line to Cyberstan and granting Super Earth a much needed victory, as Curia's liberation would signify the complete liberation of the Marspira Sector and the successful deflection of the craven mechanized assault. However, this would not be the end of Curia's problems, as the Automatons that survived would withdraw to Vernen Wells and, on August 20th, sent a second assault onto Tarsh through a newly formed FTL line connecting Vernen Wells and Tarsh, while also launching an assault onto Curia, in a desperate attempt to hold on to their vanguard at the Marspira Sector.\nOperation Ecological Immolation.\nThe Helldivers would manage to turn the tide and defend Curia, from where they then went on to capture Aesir Pass and Vernen Wells, leaving neighboring Tarsh cut off from the larger Automaton frontline which, eventually, paved the way for the complete liberation of the Marspira Sector during the last weeks of September.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nEver since its final defense on August 21st, Curia remained under firm control of Super Earth, once more standing as a bastion of peace in a region of space consistently plagued by the socialist Automatons. However, the Automatons now had revenge subroutines programmed into their systems and, after their blunders with the Jet Brigade at Marfark and their efforts in the Tanis and Gellert Sectors being successfully stopped, the Automatons would desperately launch an assault onto Curia on November 2nd, as they seeked to expand again.\nHowever, the Helldivers were now able to manage both fronts at once and, having a Major Order with the objective of preventing Automaton expansion by all means, they turned up en masse to assist with Curia's defense. The initial defensive operations turned out exceedingly successful."}

Three types of samples exist: Common Samples, Rare Samples, and Super Samples (or Super Uranium).\nUnlike other currencies, all types are directly carried by the Helldiver that picked them up. They are dropped on the ground if the carrier dies, or chooses to drop them using the Drop Menu. They will need to be picked up again as needed and carried all the way into the extraction vehicle to be gained at the end of the mission. Dropped samples can be picked up by any squadmate, being added to their own container.\nTo reduce risk, it may be preferable to spread the pickups between players in the group. Samples can also be dropped at the Extraction Zone should the squad cross it before completing the mission.\nThe total amount of samples that can be found and the amount currently carried in the mission is displayed on the HUD depending on settings (by default, the counter will only display briefly whenever a sample is picked up). The amount of samples generated per mission depends on difficulty and mission type (short missions like &lt;a href=\"Eradicate\"&gt;Eradicate&lt;/a&gt; typically will have far less and possibly not even of every type that should be available, if any at all).\nAs with the other currencies, all Helldivers will gain all samples earned at the end of the mission, regardless of who was carrying them into the extraction vehicle. Successful extraction of samples is the only way to obtain them.\nCommon Samples are found on any difficulty. The maximum amount of common samples the player can hold is 500.\nIn the area of operations, they look like plant-like bulbs on a stalk, small cases (prepared earlier by research teams), small worms in Terminid-controlled planets, or like small machinery in Automaton-controlled planets. \nRare Samples are found on Challenging Difficulty and higher.

Prominent geographic features faced by Helldivers in the first Galactic War included vast open snowfields and frozen lake beds, as well as scattered mountain ranges and open pools of exposed arctic water that could freeze a careless Helldiver in seconds. Despite its inhospitable environment, this barren on the galactic fringe was once the homeworld of the abominations of humanity, known as the Cyborgs.\nHistory.\nFirst Galactic War.\nCyberstan was the homeworld and capital of the Cyborg separatists during the events of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. Though their origins are unclear, what is known is that the human colonists of the planet had (possibly due to the harsh conditions of the planet) become obsessed with the manipulation of their bodies, replacing their skin with machines that according to them, gave them a higher meaning in life.\nWhen the planet was conquered by Super Earth, the Cyborgs were \"democratized\" once again, volunteered into the voting booths by the threat of losing their civil rights. Super Earth's Army Tactical Command stationed troops on the planet for a period of 5 years to \"keep the peace and \"run government positions\"\", after which period the Cyborgs' culture is supposed to have transitioned to a \"fully democratic\" one. Meanwhile, the Super Earth Construction Company (SECC), a government contractor, took over the massive forges and industrial complexes of Cyberstan.\nThe Cyborg separatists were finally broken in both body and spirit. Cyberstan had been conquered by Super Earth for the last time, with the Cyborgs themselves being secured away in the mines of Cyberstan, their homeworld becoming a new rehabilitation facility for them. \nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nOn April 9, 2184, a large force of &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; invaded Cyberstan and all planets connected by &lt;a href=\"FTL%20Lines\"&gt;FTL Lines&lt;/a&gt; to it. The Automatons were thought to have been eradicated from the Galaxy after their harsh defeats at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Humanity's champions&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt; during operation Swift Disassembly. Unfortunately, the bulk of their forces were lurking in the darkness, waiting to strike at the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth domains&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; were occupied on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Terminid Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvestigations into what happened are currently ongoing. What is known is that the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; Invasion Fleet, comprised of tens of thousands of warships, arrived from FTL jump to the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and overran nearly every planet in just hours, with attacks on communications networks delaying the SEAF response. The Federation of Super Earth initiated Libcon 1, with SEAF reserves being hastily scrambled whilst all Helldivers were called to deploy immediately to the defense of the sector.\nCurrently the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; refutes the claim that the Automatons have an emotional drive to retake Cyberstan, as Automatons are unfeeling machines. The correct reason for their coward attack is their vile hatred towards freedom and managed democracy. Where the Automatons hid their invasion fleet and what their true objectives could be, are questions that must be asked later.\nCyberstan currently serves as the main base of operations for the Automatons, the Children of the Cyborgs as known based on a decoded data intercept. The level of overall Cyborg involvement is unknown and whether the Automatons are merely the servants of some unknown Cyborg survivor group which evaded capture and are hellbent on revenge, or the Cyborgs as a whole is unknown."}

However, Darius' Colonial Overseer was able to see that this measure would not keep their sector safe. He immediately moved to sever all supply lines leading into the Jin Xi Sector, due to his dangerous proximity to both Turing and Acamar IV. This move would prove wise once the Terminids shifted their focus towards the Falstaff and Jin Xi sectors. But as usual, the fascist insects would find a way to bring a once peaceful planet colony of Super Earth into the war by force.\nOn September 28th, 2184, The Terminids would unprovokedly attack Darius II, in an attempt to reinforce their attack on &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; by flanking through Achird III. Darius' colonists had spent almost 6 months reinforcing their planet home, digging trenches alongside the towering plateaus and stockpiling weapons in stashes buried all over the green, acidic dunes of the planet. However, even with all that preparation, they began to falter, as the Terminid assault was too strong and, as such, they were forced to call on the Helldivers for assistance.\nDespite 60% of the entire corps assisting with Darius' defense, it would prove too late to save and, consequently, Darius II would be lost to the Terminids by the afternoon of September 29th, the Bugs now having deeply entrenched themselves into the acidic planet, following a pattern of hard defenses and difficult subsequent liberations that had been eating away at the Terminid Front for some weeks by then.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nDespite Darius' valuable position, the Terminids never made a move out of Darius after their failure to take Achird III on September 30th. As such, they instead burrowed themselves into the planet and began to build up their strength and numbers in order to reattempt an attack on Achird III once more. On October 11th, the Terminids on Darius sent a barrage of spores at Achird III and began an assault onto the planet. \nFor the first 12 hours of the invasion, the Terminids seemed to be having the upper hand, as the defenders on Achird III began to get overwhelmed. However, Achird's defenders managed to hold on for long enough that the Helldivers managed to liberate Pandion-XXIV, freeing them up to relief Achird III immediately. With a mere 20 minutes remaining before complete planetary infestation, the Helldivers managed to repel the assault on Achird III and, now knowing for certain that Achird III's flank on Turing was far too valuable to lose, the Helldivers immediately began deployment onto Darius II.\nFor 2 days, the Helldivers battled across the acidic dunes of Darius, knowing it to be such a critical position that they would be forced to let &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt; fall in order to ensure Darius II was fully captured. By October 14th, Darius II was liberated, freeing the Helldivers up to relief a struggling defense on Achernar Secundus and, consequently, freeing the Borgus Sector from the Terminid scourge once and for all.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nDarius would remain free of any Terminid presence after its liberation. It would seem that, after all, things hadn't come to boil despite the tactical miscalculation at &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Crossroads. But the seeds of fascism had already been sown on the Terminid Research Preserve, and it was only a matter of time before their bore their nefarious fruits.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nExpectedly, with the Helldivers focused on saving the critical research material at Turing, Darius-II would be lost to the Terminids by the afternoon of the following day, in a massive disaster that took millions of lives and undid all the progress achieved in the past 3 months.\nOperation Iron Rain.\nAfter the disaster at Tyranny Park, Darius-II had been left in ruins. Its settlements colonized by Terminids as its patriotic colonists watched amidsts desperate evacuations. However, after every thunder, the sunlight of Liberty always rises. Despite the immense losses at the Terminid Front, the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; was successfully fueled. And despite a chaotic initial deployment, it would ultimately be harnessed into a weapon of peace and freedom like none before it. With its mighty alloy plates, it rained planetary armaggedon onto &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;, swaths of righteous Eagles onto &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; and was indispensable in the campaign to recover Acamar IV, preventing further chaos and keeping the flame of hope alive.\nWith Operation Balance of Liberty, the Helldivers managed to recapture &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and finally eradicate the Jet Brigade at &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; before then further inflicting damage onto the robotic menace on &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;. These victories bolstered the Helldiver Corps and, most importantly, freed them up for alternative endeavors in regards to Galactic Liberation.\nFollowing a thwarted attack by the Terminids on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; on November 24th, Operation Iron Rain was declared, as the Ministry of Defense sought to conduct an efficacy review on the then-available machine guns that the SEAF had access to. With Fenrir III being successfully defended, the Helldivers turned towards the only planet left that stained the Borgus Sector with the stench of Terminid Fascism.\nFrom November 25th to November 27th, the Helldivers deployed en masse to liberate the acidic planet, with many colonists even contributing with their shovels, break-action shotguns and some with machine guns of their own. Alongside the DSS' support, the battle for Darius-II would see amounts of ammunition expenditure ranging in the hundreds of billions of bullets. After 2 days of battling, the Terminids would be sufficiently eradicated, as the last Terminid broods were vaporized through the forceful opening of sufficient concentrations of bullet holes."}

Its scattered colonies undertook a myriad of activities, from logging to farming to mining, without much oddities occurring in their everyday lives. But if the Automatons hate something, it is the simple things such as the calm and comfort that abound in the galactic fringe. \nWhen the Automatons first invaded the Valdis Sector in April, the Tanis Sector preventively cut all of its FTL Supply Lines in order to prevent the robots from spreading towards the Terminid Front, as many SEAF strategists feared the unpredictability of such an encounter. This outcome would put Demiurg through a hard time; as it also meant that, given its position of remoteness even in its own sector, Demiurg could not really fortify or stockpile supplies in case of an invasion.\nThese worries would become validated when, in September 2184, the Automatons managed to capture Clasa after the Tanis Sector's FTL Lines had been restored, which effectively left Demiurg completely isolated, caught between the metaphorical wall that was the now-disconnected Arturion Sector's planets and the very literal sword that was the Automaton Forward Base that was growing more and more fortified in Clasa, as the socialist menace prepared to continue its expansionist campaigns.\nShortly after Liberty Day, Demiurg would find itself even more isolated, as &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt; and now &lt;a href=\"Yed%20Prior\"&gt;Yed Prior&lt;/a&gt; fell against attacks coming from Clasa. It was now only a matter of time before the Automatons turned their sights onto Demiurg, as it was the only remaining planet in the Tanis Sector that hadn't rebuked them, all while &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; had grown too fortified for the Automatons to push for.\nThe Automatons initiated their invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt; on October 28th, with the twin invasions of &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt;. So far, it seemed like the Automatons would continue all the way to &lt;a href=\"Zosma\"&gt;Zosma&lt;/a&gt; and conquer the Gellert Sector, which would buy Demiurg much needed time, but then the Helldivers managed to repel the Automatons at &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt;, which forced them to turn the concentrated remains of their forces towards the only planet that they hadn't yet attempted to invade so far.\nOn the early hours of October 31st, SEAF Colonial Defense Network channels began to flood with calls for aid coming from Demiurg's garrison. Having been under siege for a month and having been unable to prepare ever since they had been cut off the FTL Network on April, Demiurg was pretty much incapable of either evacuating nor repelling the invaders and, comprehensibly, called for immediate Helldiver support.\nWith the Helldivers having orders to prevent further Automaton expansion, Demiurg would see half of the Helldiver Corps, around 22,000 Super Destroyers, show up in droves to support the besieged planet."}

{"id": "6470", "revid": "46883485", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6470", "title": "Democracy Space Station", "text": "Considered a great leap forward for Managed Democracy, the Democracy Space Station is an interplanetary battle-station based on liberated First Galactic War Era battle plans. The DSS promises to be a powerful strategic tool for reshaping the Galactic Map - democratically directed by the Helldivers themselves. With the Helldivers protecting it, the Democracy Space Station will soon be ready to rain down the will of the people on any who would stand in its way.\nGeneral.\nDetails on the exact layout of the interior of the DSS are currently unavailable and it's capabilities are naturally highly classified. Even so the construction site of the space station orbiting around &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; is an order of magnitude larger than the standard &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and utterly dwarfs anything else which Super Earth has put into orbit so far -- save perhaps the shipyards that orbit &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis large size however came at a cost as it was well beyond the capacity of Super Earth's current Alcubiere Warp Drives to transport without astronomic E-710 consumption. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; established a new, state-of-the-art Xenoentomology Center on &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; in order to prototype and develop new High-Efficiency Alcubiere Drives, capable of effectively transporting gigastructures like the DSS. Even then the DSS still requires a 20-story reusable fuel tanks, and key personnel have to input the long and highly confidential activation code at their designated terminals whenever the space station is activated.\nIn addition the station's protective plating required a (relatively) lightweight but above all durable material capable of surviving immense warp speeds during FTL travel. In the end, Super Earth's engineers chose a alloy of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.newscientist.com/article/2350789-toughest-material-ever-is-an-alloy-of-chromium-cobalt-and-nickel/\"&gt;chromium, cobalt and nickel&lt;/a&gt;, the toughest material ever tested. Fortunately, SEAF Command were able to identify atmospheric readings on &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; indicating that the Automatons were already engaging in deep-mantle mining operations on the planet. Thus the Helldivers liberated their mining tunnels and facilities, which not only greatly accelerated the construction of the Deep Mantle Forge but would also deny the Automatons their own access to the high-cost mine network.\nThe stately behemoth also requires a similarly behemoth number of able bodied crewmen. Though applications from patriotic, detail-oriented team-players have been pouring in, the DSS requires over 1.3 million skilled workers. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Humanity\"&gt;Ministry of Humanity&lt;/a&gt; has therefore authorized the relocation of an unprecedented number of colonists from &lt;a href=\"Terrek\"&gt;Terrek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;. When polled, those affected by recent bug attacks proved the most eager to serve, with citizens of all ages being safely evacuate to the DSS. Since then these evacuees have all been put on generous contracts and underwent accelerated bootcamps in orbital weapons handling -- experiencing the glory of the warfront, the freedom of space, and the camaraderie of dormitory living.\nWhilst the unfinished DSS construction site was highly vulnerable to attack from the enemies of Super Earth, as the station's armor plating has not been fully installed and its extensive defensive systems had not yet come online, this is no longer an issue since the station's completion and activation. Not only is the station protected by hardened (but lightweight) alloy plating, but also a suite of 77 PRESIDENTIAL-Class Cannons, a massive fleet of Eagle fighters housed in an equally massive three-tiered Convocation Bay and of course it's Zero G Anti-Ship Missile System. Truly, no other ship in the Super Earth Navy can compare to the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle-station!\nHistory.\nWhilst the details of the project remain highly classified, during the first Galactic War an advanced weapons lab on the planet of &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was working on the development of a powerful interplanetary battle station. However, the project was abandoned along with the laboratory (and the planet) due to high levels of radiation on X-45 -- possibly following the responsible use of planet-wide nuclear weapons bombardment.\nAfter a little over two months of intense research on the 25th of September, 2184, construction of the Democracy Space Station was finally ready to begin. The DSS promised to be a powerful strategic tool for reshaping the Galactic Map \u2014 democratically directed by the Helldivers themselves. However to actually construct the DSS, an orbital construction site must first be secured.\nOf the planets within Super Earth's reach, only two have large enough &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere\"&gt;magnetospheres&lt;/a&gt; for safe construction: &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the Helldivers would liberate Gaellivare from the Automatons', with a &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;DSS Logistics Hub&lt;/a&gt; being set up nearby to manage the massive inflow of resources and manpower to the new construction site.\nHowever, to build a weapon of mass liberation of this size, the Helldivers will need to make significant advancements in three key areas: zero-g materials science, FTL propulsion, and gigastructure staffing. The Helldivers will be indispensable in achieving these breakthroughs. Helldivers are advised that failing any DSS-related order will cause delays in construction. A project of this scale cannot be concealed indefinitely; if construction drags out too long, our enemies will eventually discover its location, and attempt to destroy it. However, our citizens need not fear. With the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; protecting it, the Democracy Space Station will soon be ready to rain down the will of the people on any who would stand in its way.\nAdditionally, during construction, the DSS will be extremely vulnerable to attack, so long-term defensibility is paramount. The DSS could change the course of the war. Its ultimate success or failure lies in the hands of our greatest heroes: the Helldivers.\nPhase 1.\nUpon liberation, a DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; was built to support the mass scale of the construction; Super Earth High Command determined that zero-g materials, FTL propulsion, and gigastructure staffing needed significant advancements to make the DSS a reality. High Command also reminded Helldivers that they would be crucial in the defense of the DSS should it come under attack, and any failures to do so would delay its construction.\nSoon after establishing the DSS, High Command began tasking the Helldivers to liberate planets to establish facilities for the advancements needed for the DSS. &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; was selected to build the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science's&lt;/a&gt; new Xenoentomology Center for high-efficiency Alcubierre drives. Helldivers quickly liberated the planet from the Terminid scourge while also defending Tarsh's Logistics Hub. High Command noted that the Center would still need to be defended from any potential attacks or research will be lost.\nTo create FTL-resistant alloy for the DSS, a deep-mantle forge would be required due to the extreme heat and pressure. Luckily, High Command found that the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; already had a deep-mantle mining complex. Seeking to repurpose it into something more democratic, High Command ordered the Helldivers to liberate Claorell and seize the complex. They would be successful, filling the mines with Super Earth's own in the new Deep Mantle Forge Complex. However, High Command found intel that revealed that the Automatons were creating &lt;a href=\"Automatons%23Jet%20Brigade\"&gt;exceptionally light metal for armor plating&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after, the Automatons attempted to take back Claorell, accompanied by cyberattacks on DSS-related servers. The Helldivers would be successful in defending Claorell; the cyberattacks revealed the DSS project to the Automatons, but the DSS's exact location remains a mystery to them--for now.\nPhase 2.\nWith the Xenoentomology Center and Deep Mantle Forge Complex built, the DSS moved into Phase 2. Due to the DSS's scale, it would require significant amounts of E-710, leading to the establishment of the Terminid Research Preserve on &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;. It would provide research capabilities and another source of E-710. The Helldivers would need to liberate and hold the nearby planets of Crimsica, Turing, Darius II, Pandion-XXIV, and Gacrux to establish a planetary quarantine zone around Acamar IV. The Helldivers would successfully create the quarantine needed for the construction of the Terminid Research Preserve, furthering E-710 research.\nThe peace following Super Earth's victory would not last long, as the Automatons would launch an assault group, the Jet Brigade, onto numerous planets, in search of the DSS. In a war of attrition, the Helldivers bravely fought against the relentless Jet Brigade. Though the Jet Brigade managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, they were eventually weak enough to be stopped on &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the Helldivers' efforts, the Automatons were unable to find the DSS and its related facilities.\nTo further protect the DSS, High Command determined that liberating &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; would provide a defensive buffer for the DSS against a potential Jet Brigade assault. However, a sudden &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; outbreak on &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; threatened the newly-built Terminid Research Preserve. The Helldivers were then left to decide which to prioritize, in which they chose to liberate Lesath. Another Terminid outbreak would occur on Pandion-XXIV, eventually leading to its fall alongside Gacrux. The DSS will continue to stay protected, but the Terminid Research Preserve is now dangerously close to heavy Terminid presence.\nPhase 3.\nThe continued protection of the DSS has allowed it to advance to its final construction phase before its long-awaited completion.\nCompletion.\nThe DSS construction was declared complete on November 11, 2184. All that remains is the necessary E-710 to bring it online. Around 10000 Helldivers have deployed to &lt;a href=\"Trandor\"&gt;Trandor&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the necessary fuel to power the ship. At the DSS itself, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; have re-launched the Jet Brigade, and are still trying to find out the DSS\u2019s location. They have attacked the logistic hub of &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;, and while we may lose the planet, as long as Gaellivare itself is under our control, there should be no issues. Only time will tell if the planet is attacked, and Helldivers are to be on high alert in the coming days for any other attacks.\nActivation.\nFinally, on November 13th, 2184, at 21:37 SEST - EST, the required amount of E-710 for the DSS Activation was completed, allowing the Helldivers to vote on the Democracy Space Station's first deployment and donate samples towards its functions.\nAmong its first actions was supporting a counterattack on &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;, from which the &lt;a href=\"Automatons%23Jet%20Brigade\"&gt;Jet Brigade&lt;/a&gt; launched its attack on Gaellivare, having discovered the DSS' location a few days prior. Despite a ferocious day of continuous orbital barrage, Mastia remained under Automaton control. DSS administrators noticed a troubling increase in Helldiver and civilian deaths despite orders to take shelter indoors. Helldiver deployments were increased to bring the death toll back to an acceptable level. Use of the &lt;a href=\"FX-12%20Shield%20Generator%20Relay\"&gt;FX-12 Shield Generator Relay&lt;/a&gt; was also authorized.\nThe next day, the DSS returned to Gaellivare to support the planet's defense. Here too, operations were difficult as an Eagle Storm deployed to the surface initially targeted inactive areas. High Command ordered Eagle wings to more directly support Helldivers, resulting in a successful Major Order, yet still posing a risk of losing Gaellivare only shortly afterward, and another spurious surge in Helldiver casualties.\nThe Helldiver Corps then voted to send the DSS to &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; to impose a blockade, despite no active attacks by Terminid forces. Successfully taking it out of the reach of the Automatons as Gaellivare was left to it's fate. \nSabotage, De-activation and Repairs.\nOver the coming weeks, the Democracy would prove itself an invaluable -- if temperamental -- weapon of mass liberation. Yet despite bringing freedom and managed democracy to over a dozen worlds, the dissident enemies of managed democracy will stop at nothing to stop Super Earth's noble mission. Following multiple catastrophic system failures in the middle of Operation Bughammer, the Democracy Space Station would be forcibly (and hopefully temporarily) taken offline. Naturally sabotage is suspected, with all 1.3 million personnel aboard the DSS to undergo security screenings whilst the station is locked down for repairs. \nHowever whether by design or pure coincidence, shortly after the Democracy Space Station was shuttered for refit, the Federation would face it's greatest challenge yet as the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Galaxy and invaded &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; on December 12th, starting a new and deadly \"&lt;a href=\"Southern%20Front\"&gt;Southern Front&lt;/a&gt;\" to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;second galactic war&lt;/a&gt;. Never the less, freedom waits for nobody and so the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; will have to make do fighting off the xenophobic squids without their greatest weapon for the time being... \nTactical Actions.\nThe Democracy Space Station possesses 3 Tactical Actions. Players can donate resources to help activate any of the 3 functions for the next 24 hours, but only 1 tactical action can be active at a time. The amount of resources, as well as the type they can donate, can be found below. \nOrbital Blockade.\nVoting.\nEvery 24 hours, the Helldivers can vote to move the DSS to a different planet or keep it at its current location. After the 24 hours have passed, the planet with the most votes becomes the new DSS location and new votes can be cast. Helldivers may not change their vote after submitting, so it is recommended to think twice before voting.\nThe list of possible DSS locations does NOT currently update alongside the Galactic War Map, instead appearing to function on a \"snapshot\" mechanic, where the list will be created using only the planets that were accessible in the moments after the DSS moved. This can lead to discrepancies, such as the Helldivers being able to vote for the DSS to be sent to a planet that may be inaccessible, such as when the DSS was sent to &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Jetclipper\"&gt;Operation Jetclipper&lt;/a&gt; despite Choohe being cut off the FTL Network. As such, caution is advised when voting.\nJudging by how the Democracy Space Station came online on November 13th, 2024, at 21:37 EST (18:37 PST / 3:37 CET in Stockholm, Sweden / 2:37 GMT in London, United Kingdom), it may be prudent to check in at this time daily in order to donate resources and vote for the next DSS Location again. This recommendation will be rescinded once there is more information regarding how the 24-hour limit works for the DSS functions."}

Its general landscape is rather grassy and barren, but makes up for it with its poor visibility due to consistently negative weather conditions. The planet is the center of some of the heaviest fighting on the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; front, with the battles over it being marked by logistical issues for the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nDraupnir, a simple craggy grassland planet. Most who visit the planet will most likely experience a thin layer of fog, giving a nice atmosphere to it. The landmass of the planet is divided up in to various archipelagos, with few continent sized land covered in mountains.\nHowever when a thunderstorm rolls in, the sky can become covered with dark clouds, only being broke up with lightning. The sound of wind only being silent with a loud thunderclap. And during this time, many may notice a glowing lifeform, swimming through the air, almost majestically. It is unknown as of current date what these creatures are, as they seem to be the only life on this planet.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOnce the Automaton Expedition began in early February 2184, Draupnir became one of the main staging points for the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; on their way to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt;-controlled &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon&lt;/a&gt; Sectors. The heavy presence of the Helldivers was expected to attract the attention of the Automaton military, although for the first week of the war the planet remained untouched.\nFirst Battle of Draupnir (Feb. 15th-18th).\nOn February 15th, after a week of fierce fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; forces launched an offensive into the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt; with Draupnir quickly becoming a center of attention in this front. With the fighting in the sector, the planet had been on the forefront from day one, seeing some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; utilized the unique, rough, and uneven terrain on the planet to their advantage, as it helped in slowing down the Automaton's &lt;a href=\"Hulk\"&gt;Hulks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tanks&lt;/a&gt;. The terrrain also gave the Helldivers an advantage in terms of cover, letting them fire down on Automaton forces behind rocks, hills, etc. \nDraupnir became another focal point in the propaganda campaign to recruit more troops to fight the Automatons as the defense of the planet was shown as the one thing keeping the rest of the sector from falling. And this campaign was successful, as thousands of Helldivers deployed into the planet and quickly managed to liberate it alongside &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter was only liberated for a short few hours before more Automaton forces attacked.\nSecond Battle of Draupnir (Feb. 19th-20th).\nWith only one Earth-day of peace on Draupnir, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; yet again launched an attack against the planet just as the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; successfully won the defense campaign on &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as news reached High Command of the attack, a defense order was called for the planet.\nThe Second Battle is seen as one of the bloodiest for the Helldivers. Due to logistical and manpower issues caused by the Helldivers being caught off-guard, not predicting a counter-attack would come so soon, the Helldivers suffered major losses on the planet, which was not helped by most of the reinforcements being new recruits. And, because of this, the defense order was lost and the Automatons took control of the planet.\nThird Battle of Draupnir (Feb. 20th-25th).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; used their regained control over Draupnir as a staging point for another attack on &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt;, dwindling the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt;' ability to send more troops to retake the planet effectively. This battle saw a reduction of the active troops on the planet, continuing the trend towards making the fighting on it even more brutal.\nOn February 23rd, Mantes was liberated, and many had hoped this would lead to more reinforcements on Draupnir. But, unfortunately for the Helldivers, the remaining Automatons on Mantes did not retreat into their own territory but instead attacked &lt;a href=\"Ingmar\"&gt;Ingmar&lt;/a&gt;, further delaying &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth's&lt;/a&gt; ability to send a proper force of reinforcements to Draupnir. Ingmar was rapidly liberated, but another attack was launched on Mantes and this time also on &lt;a href=\"P%C3%B6pli%20IX\"&gt;P\u00f6pli IX&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeeing the progress on Draupnir, Helldivers began prioritizing the liberation of the planet, as it was closer to victory than the other ones attacked. Finally, on February 25th, Draupnir was again liberated, granting Super Earth forces access to &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth Battle of Draupnir (Feb. 26th-27th).\nYet again the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; did not give &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; more than a day to rest on Draupnir, and this time it proved important. A massive attack began on Draupnir, and the Fourth Battle of Draupnir became the deadliest (relatively to how long it lasted), as all Helldiver forces on the planet were wiped out within a single day, to the point they, for the first time, lost access to the planet and together with it the entire &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The loss of the Fourth Battle of Draupnir became a tragic moment in the war, as the planet was the main point connecting &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; forces to the battlefields on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt;, but morale remained relatively high as the planet of &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; was fully liberated shortly after.\nFifth Battle of Draupnir (Feb.28th-Mar. 3rd).\nA day after the loss of Draupnir &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt; was liberated, giving &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; access to the planet again, and thus also to the rest of the Severin Sector, in a major victory for &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. But, at the same time, also a sign of the major losses the Helldivers had suffered. Around the same time the Fifth Battle began, the Helldivers failed with the major order granted to them by high command to win at least 8 defense campaigns against the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;, which led to protests by Super Earth citizens calling for a greater effort to fight the Automatons.\nOn March 3rd, the planet was again lost when Super Earth lost contact with the forces on it following yet another defeat on Mantes. Thus, yet again, Super Earth lost access to the entire Severin Sector.\nSixth Battle of Draupnir (Mar. 4th-18th).\nOn March 4th, &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt; was re-liberated, and for the last time as of March 15th. This allowed the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; to focus their attention fully on Draupnir for the first time in a while in the war. Upon the beginning of the Sixth Battle of Draupnir, a single division of Helldivers had been deployed on the planet and has consistently fought on it. \nOn March 7th The planet was used by the Automatons as a staging point for their offensive into the &lt;a href=\"Theseus%20Sector\"&gt;Theseus Sector&lt;/a&gt;, where the planet of &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Kwan\"&gt;Tien Kwan&lt;/a&gt;, a testing site for &lt;a href=\"EXO-45%20Patriot%20Exosuit\"&gt;experimental weaponry&lt;/a&gt; for the Helldivers at the time, is situated. Because of this, Helldiver forces on Draupnir were momentarily isolated, almost leading to the collapse of the planet. But, thanks to the quick defense of Tien Kwan, Helldiver forces were able to rapidly return to Draupnir with new and improved weaponry, although the planet remains a deadly battleground.\nOn the 15th of March, Malevelon Creek completely fell to Automaton control. In reaction to this, the Ministry of Truth began to call for Helldivers to completely focus their attention on the liberation of Draupnir before the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt; had to suffer yet another defeat at the hands of an Automaton offensive. \nThe Sixth Battle of Draupnir saw wide usage of guerilla warfare by the Helldivers, more than in any of the battles before it. Ironically, thanks to how long they've been fighting over Draupnir, the Helldivers became so familiar with the terrain that the guerilla war waged on the planet was one of the most successful in their history. \nBy the 16th of March, tens of thousands of more Helldivers deployed into Draupnir in the largest increase of manpower the planet had seen in weeks. By this point, Draupnir became the most important battlefield on the Automaton Front. If the Helldivers were to liberate it, then they could fully focus their attention on &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; and Malevelon Creek, where some of the planned reinforcements for Draupnir went instead. Within a day, the liberation percentage went from 20% to ~43%, although the casualty rate for the Helldivers had reached ~13 million. The next day on March 17th, the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; had been completed, bringing full attention to the front lines of Draupnir. \nOn March 18th, following a sharp increase of Helldiver operations against the Automatons on Draupnir in what became the longest period of fighting on the planet yet, the planet was liberated, letting thousands of Helldivers into the Severin and Theseus Sectors, more than had been seen in weeks. \nSeventh Battle of Draupnir (Mar. 29th-31st).\nAfter the longest period of peace on the planet yet since the start of the war, which saw &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver&lt;/a&gt; forces capture &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; in a swift offensive against the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;, Draupnir was again a victim of a surprise attack by Automaton forces. The Automatons, holding a massive amount of firepower, hoped to use Draupnir to split the Helldiver forces who earlier began a campaign into &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; hoping to open up the space routes to &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt;, the location of major Automaton factories.\nHigh Command issued a statement to the Helldivers about the new stage of the war against the Automatons, proposing two plans for the Helldivers: \nIn the end, though, the Ubanea Gambit failed and Draupnir fell, Ubanea following suit. The main cause behind the loss was blamed to be the indecisiveness of the Helldivers in the initial hours after the attack on Draupnir began. The loss of Draupnir and Ubanea led High Command to shed light on the issues of too many Helldivers focusing on the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; front and &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, where progress was either way expected to be slow. In the same statement, an order was given to all Helldivers to deploy on Draupnir and open the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt; back up. This offensive, the last one on Draupnir as of May 3rd, succeeded and the liberation of Draupnir resulted in a major victory for the Helldivers as hundreds of thousands of them went through Draupnir into Severin to fight what were the last battles of the first stage of the war against the Automatons.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nDraupnir, and all of the heroes buried beneath its verdant hills, would not see the last of the war. Despite the victory at Malevelon Creek, the Automatons would return once more for a second round of futile resistance against Humanity. From April to June, Draupnir would watch as the Automatons slowly carved a path of blood and tyranny from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in June 21st, after 2 failed attempts, the Automatons launched an assault on the underdefended Mort. It fell by the next day.\nFearing the desecration of the tombs of its valiant martyrs, Super Earth High Command ordered the Helldivers to defend all planets on the Xzar Sector. While Draupnir would thankfully see no action, it would watch in horror as the Automatons tried and failed to take over neighboring Mantes using a newly-acquired ability: They opened a new FTL Line from &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; to Mantes and launched a surprise assault."}

It is capable of aerospace superiority fighter operations, as well as performing precision ground attack operations in support of Helldiver surface missions.\nThe Eagle's ordnance payload is modular and can include a variety of direct fire cannons, guided missiles, or various guided and unguided bombs. However, loiter duration, flight performance envelope, and rearming time can vary significantly depending on the type of weapon load delivered to the target area as well as the modifications made to the individual Eagle Fighter.\nSuper Earth High Command would also like to take this opportunity to dispel rumors that eagle fighter pilots have been physically augmented to better perform their assigned duties and that any personnel caught with unauthorized body modifications may in fact be Automaton dissidents. Stay vigilant Helldivers!\nGeneral Tips.\nThe Eagle Fighter offers quick-response close air support to the Helldiver on the ground. In contrast to stratagems, it provides greatly reduced call-in time, but carries a limited amount of ammunition. Eagle stratagems have 1-4 uses each, after which the Eagle Fighter must return to the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; in order to get its supplies restocked.\nEagle-1 can be commanded to return to the Super Destroyer for early resupply with the Eagle Rearm stratagem. This can be used to replenish an often-used stratagem even when charges of other stratagems remain. While resupplying, Eagle strikes are unavailable to the Helldiver.\nEagle strikes are oriented relative to Helldiver. Strafing Runs and the 500kg Bomb arrive from behind, dropping forward; while all other strikes arrive from one side, dropping in a line in front of (or on top of) the Helldiver calling it in. Eagle-1 may reposition the attack run to maximize enemy casualties. Notably, the 110mm Rocket Pods are aimed at the largest target (including vulnerable structures) near the stratagem beacon.\nEagle-1 deploys flares while exiting the attack run, returning to high altitude. On Automaton planets, anti-air emplacements may attack Eagle-1, occasionally causing an errant drop, or inflicting enough damage to warrant immediate repairs on the Super Destroyer. AA emplacements will also prevent Helldivers from targeting them with Eagle strikes, forcing them to use other measures. As of yet, Eagle-1 will not alert the Helldiver of incoming AA fire taken, and will only give a standard \"returning to rearm\" prompt if forced to retreat.\nNotes.\nThe Eagle model is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Z-95_Headhunter\"&gt;Z-95 Headhunter&lt;/a&gt; with the folding wings of an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//starwars.fandom.com/wiki/A/SF-01_B-wing_starfighter\"&gt;A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter&lt;/a&gt; and V-19 Torrent from Star Wars.

It is becoming apparent that the Second Galactic War is one of the worst losses of life ever experienced in history.\nHistory.\nFebruary 2024.\nThe Eastern Front opened on February 8th. The &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; are a race of fascistic alien scum who were responsible for this heinous act against peace. Ever since the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, Terminids were successfully and peacefully harnessed by Super Earth to create E-710, a valuable resource and the very fuel of Managed Democracy. The special military operations preceding the war began with Terminid revolts on multiple planets. The first plan to resist Terminid invasion began with the \"&lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;TCS&lt;/a&gt;\" on various barrier planets in the Orion sector. With the first Automaton attacks coinciding with the emergence of the fascist threat, forces were divided between the two fronts. Fighting was focused in the Orion sector throughout February and early March. \nMarch 2024.\nWith the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt; in early March, the offensive focus shifted to the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut sector&lt;/a&gt;. The Terminid Control System was established here to prevent the coreward spread of fascism. The main front line began to develop within the Umlaut, Draco, and Mirin sectors. These three sectors would consistently see the heaviest fighting between man and bug. The establishment of the TCS temporarily contained the Terminid population to the Outer Rim of the galaxy. \nApril 2024.\nWith footholds into the Draco and Mirin sectors, Helldiver forces shifted to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; throughout April. The return of the automatons in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Northwest&lt;/a&gt; following their complete defeat further reduced Helldiver concentration in the east. As heavy fighting continued throughout April, a brief respot to kill 2,000,000,000 Terminids for E-710 was declared following the establishment of the Menkent-Lesath line in the Northwest. A Terminid counter attack in the Draco and Mirin sectors was launched concurrently with an Automaton one. This terminid breakout was resisted. It is important to note that the fighting in the Draco and Mirin sectors was a constant back-and-forth from this point on. By the end of April, another threat had came from the failure of the TCS. This resulted in the evolution of resistance in the Terminid population, and an enemy breakthrough into the Umlaut sector. The adaptation in the Terminids resulted in their takeover on Meridia, which would go on to transform the world into a super colony. The TCS was successfully deactivated in the Umlaut sector.\nMay 2024.\nDue to the spores produced by the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, Terminid infestations were introduced to the Orion and Jin Xi Sectors. Helldiver forces failed to stop all of these assaults. Later in May, Angel's Venture and Heeth were retaken. A xenocide offensive this month would fail to reach their target number however. With the rapid expansion checked, Helldiver forces began the push to retake the Umlaut sector and destroy the Meridia Supercolony. Two hard offensives led to the recapture of the Umlaut sector and the destruction of Meridia. Meridia was the first planet to be turned into a black hole via the use of dark fluid. \nJune 2024.\nEarly in June, The Umlaut sector was completely liberated. Fighting by this point was in full swing in the Jin Xi Sector. Later this month, an offensive into the Draco and Mirin sector was successful. Hellmire was a particular stronghold of resistance in this month. Most of the fighting consisted of stagnant back-and-forth combat this month. The first battle of &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; also happened this month, the first time Helldivers fought in deep forested swamps. \nJuly 2024.\nIn July, the Falstaff sector was attacked for the first time. Early in this month, an operation was undertaken to liberate the Falstaff and Jin Xi sectors, reducing terminid presence there significantly. A xenocidal operation was also carried out shortly after Operation Starslayer for research purposes. In mid-july, the terminids counterattacked on &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, and these planets would fall quickly. July has been characterized by disorganized and bogged down liberation campaigns across the frontline. In late July, Terminids returned to the Umlaut sector. There was heavy fighting on Turing and Acamar IV. The next day, another xenocidal operation began to kill a billion bugs.\nAugust 2024.\nWith the offensive in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; slowing down, Helldivers began another general Xenocide offensive on the 2nd. This led to the capture of &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; after a month of hard fighting.\nNoteable Planets / Battles.\n&lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt;: The farthest the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; have ever pushed into Super Earth space.\n&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;: The first planet to ever become a Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a black hole.\n&lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt;: The first Swamp planet.\n&lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;: The first Foggy Swamp planet.\n&lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;: A hellish planet that has seen near constant fighting - famous for its Fire tornadoes.\n&lt;a href=\"Peacock\"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;: The farthest the Helldivers have ever pushed into Terminid space.\n&lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;: First planet to be invaded by two enemy factions.\nSome of the most fought over planets include &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;."}

Much like other planets around it, such as &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bellatrix\"&gt;Bellatrix&lt;/a&gt;, the colonists at Elysian Meadows would first struggle but then, as they became more accustomed to their environment, they began to find success and prosperity until they managed to accumulate enough wealth to build urbanized settlements on which to house its ever-growing population. However, the colonists at Elysian Meadows were being stalked from within the endless depths of space.\nThe , an ancient foe of Super Earth that had been defeated once during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, had now returned and was seeking revenge. On December 21st, the Illuminate would send a raid onto the planet, amidst a major order centered on the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridian Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. The Helldivers that could were immediately deployed onto Elysian Meadows, while the bulk of the force focused on holding the line at &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nElysian Meadows is a reference to the \"Elysian Fields\" or \"Elysian Plains\", which is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time and was maintained by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults. It was initially separated from the Greek underworld \u2013 the realm of Hades. Only mortals related to the gods and other heroes could be admitted past the river Styx. Later, the conception of who could enter was expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic. They would remain at the Elysian Fields after death, to live a blessed and happy afterlife, and indulge in whatever they had enjoyed in life.\nThe name Elysian Meadows suggests that the planet is quite pleasant and implies that it is a location where many veteran SEAF and Helldivers have retired to after completing service and are exceptionally democratic individuals."}

It shares the likeness of the &lt;a href=\"Retrieve%20Essential%20Personnel\"&gt;Retrieve Essential Personnel&lt;/a&gt; mission, however instead of simply evacuating the personnel, the Helldiver must do 1-2 sub objectives before being able to do so.\nA similar Evacuate Colonists mission appears on planets threatened by &lt;a href=\"The%20Illuminate\"&gt;The Illuminate&lt;/a&gt;. Building layouts are adapted for the urban environment, but the mission progresses in a similar manner.\nGameplay.\nAt the start of this mission, an Evacuation Shuttle will approach the site and land in its Shuttle Bay. It will wait there until the mandated number of civilians have been collected.\nStep 1: Establish Communication Uplink(s).\nBefore being able to evacuate the civilians the Helldiver must first activate the designated Communications Tower(s) to notify the civilians that help is on the way. There will always be at least one of these sub objectives, however on Suicide Mission (7) + there will be guaranteed two that must be completed before initiating the evacuation. \nWhen entering the area of a Communications Tower the Helldiver will be granted access to the \"SSSD Delivery\" stratagem that is required to call in to progress the sub-objective. It is recommended to call this in immediately, that way the SSSD is at the ready when needed. There will be a nearby terminal that the Helldiver must log in to using the standard directional inputs. After logging in, they will be required to open the SSSD Hatch on the nearby uplink box. From there they must take the SSSD that was dropped via stratagem and insert it into the uplink box and then use the terminal to align the communication signal to 100% strength. Once finished, the Helldiver must put in one final directional code to finish the sub objective.\nStep 2: Evacuate Priority Citizens.\nOnce the sub objective(s) has been completed the Helldiver may go to the designated location to begin the evacuation process. Upon arrival there will be a handful of hostiles to be eliminated, after which it is recommended that Helldivers deploy defensive stratagems such as turrets and mortars. During this time the Helldiver can see an evacuation shuttle fly down from orbit and land inside the evacuation building. \nWhen the Helldiver is ready, they can access the Terminal located in front of said evacuation building by logging in, setting the evacuation coordinates, and opening the shuttle bay door. From there the Helldiver must go to the local shelter doors and hit the button located just outside of them, notifying the civilians inside that they may move to the evacuation building. There will always be two shelter doors to access civilians from, whereas there are always three on the Evacuate Essential Personnel mission. Each shelter door can be accessed once every 33 seconds, and will deploy three civilians that will run to the evacuation building. It is the Helldivers' job to ensure their safety and get them there alive. Once the required amount of civilians have made it to the evacuation building, the mission will be considered complete and the Helldiver can watch the evacuation shuttle leave the building and fly into orbit."}

Most Encirclements during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; are destroyed but some like the Ymir Encirclment hold on long enough for them to be broken out and join the main force.\nYmir Encirclement.\nThe Ymir Encirclement was a region of Super Earth space from May 21st to June 10th and from June 11th to July 16th. It was created when &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; cutting the only &lt;a href=\"FTL%20Lines\"&gt;FTL line&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; also was invaded blocking FTL access to the Sector. After &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; fell, &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was the only planet under Super Earth control in the sector. Vega Bay would be liberated during Operation Firewall making to so X-45 was not surrounded by Automaton controlled world but it did not have FTL lines to any of them intel 3 days later. &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; would be attacked cutting the only FTL line again. Little happened after this and before Operation Starslayer accept &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; being invaded. During Operation Starslayer the Automatons would take Wezen and Bega Bay reaching X-45 but being beaten back. Operation Andromeda was the Operation to finally end the Ymir Encirclment and free the forces trapped inside, ending with the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;.\nMatar Bay Encirclement.\nThe Matar Bay Encirclement was a region of Automaton space from July 14th to August 14th, 2184 that was cut of from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the main Automaton force. During Operation Andromeda, the pocket was formed by the successful captures of &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The latter half of Operation Andromeda, as well as Operation Righteous Expunge were dedicated to clearing the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; of resistance. Operation Liberty Crush was the largest offensive against the encirclement, pushing it to only three planets. Further efforts in August during Operation Lighthouse led to the complete destruction of Automaton forces in the pocket.\nHistory.\nOn July 14th, this entire region of space was separated from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan's&lt;/a&gt; supply lines with the fall of Matar Bay. After Operation Starslayer's successful defence of Super Earth holdings in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir sector&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons were left weakened and vulnerable. Only Aesir Pass and Matar Bay were left to connect their supply lines in the far west. On July 11th, the Helldivers began the offensive to form the pocket. By the end of the operation, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; were retaken from the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn July 17th, the operation came to an end. The severely weakened state of the Automaton forces meant that small groups of Helldivers could make progress even without a major order to direct them. By July 18th, small forces ranging from 200 - 1000 had made ~4% of liberation progress on &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Righteous Expunge targeted Charon Prime for liberation, a task already well underway by remnants of the attacking force on Martale.\nBy July 21st, Operation Righteous Expunge had seen the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime.&lt;/a&gt;\nOperation Liberty Crush began on July 27th, 2184 with the aim of clearing out this region. Prior to this, significant parts of &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; were occupied by the enemy. This operation saw the recapture of Wasat shortly thereafter, but just as Vega Bay was almost retaken, X-45 came under attack on the 30th. This assault would reconnect Automaton forces to the pocket if Vega Bay was not captured. By the end of this operation, only &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; remained in enemy hands.\nOn August 10th, the final campaign to end the Matar Bay Encirclement began. Wezen was captured in the previous days without a Major Order. Operation Finest Phalanx dictated that Troost and Vandalon IV must be captured by August 15th. Vandalon fell rapidly, with Troost near defeat on the 13th.\nThe encirclement was finally destroyed with the fall of &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; on August 14th. Celebrations broke out across free space, with citizens burning scrap metal to celebrate this final defeat.\nMarspira Encirclement.\nThe Marspira Encirclement was a region of Automaton space that was cut of from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the main Automaton force from September 1st to September 8th. The Encirclement was created when &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; was liberated cutting of &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; from the main Automatons forces. This would continue for 7 days intel &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Automatons and re-connected it to &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTanis Encirclment.\nThe Tanis Encirclement was a region of Automaton space that was cut of from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the main Automaton force from October 25th to November 22nd and November 25th to December 27. The Encirclement was created when &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; was liberated cutting all FTL line to Cyberstan to the Sector. The Encirclment was made of three planets &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of Enemy Resistance falling to 0.00% the planets stayed at 2% or 1.5%, this is why &lt;a href=\"Yed%20Prior\"&gt;Yed Prior&lt;/a&gt; was able to be invaded by encircled forces on October 27th and &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt; on the 28th, extending the Encirclment into the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion was repelled on the 31st and &lt;a href=\"Demiurg\"&gt;Demiurg&lt;/a&gt; on the 1st. Nothing would happen in the encirclement intel &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; was invaded on the 21st of November, with its fall a day later Automaton forces were re-connected with the main force ending the encirclement. Not 3 days later Lesath would be liberated re-cutting the &lt;a href=\"FTL%20Lines\"&gt;FTL line&lt;/a&gt; this also coincided with the second attack on Zzaniah Prime which succeeded, but after this the front when silent intel Operation Crop Dust this would kick out the Automatons from the Gellert Sector, the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;DSS&lt;/a&gt; was deployed the Zzaniah Prime then Mintoria and then Blistica liberated all three in three days. After this the DSS was deployed the Vog-Sojoth and was then sabotaged unable to leave the system. Nothing happened after this and the return of the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; intel the 26th when Lesath was attacked, the defence failed and the encirclement was over.\nGar Haren Encirclment.\nThe Gar Haren Encirclement was a region of Terminid space that was cut of from the main Terminid force from from October 29 to November 22nd. The Encirclement was created when &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt; was liberated during Operation Adamant Resolve cutting &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt; of from the Terminid FTL network. Gar Haren would stay as encircled for nearly a month intel the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;DSS&lt;/a&gt; was deployed to Gar Haren quickly liberating it and ending the encirclement.\nMartale Encirclements.\nThe Martale Encirclement is a region of Automaton space that is cut of from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the main Automaton force since October 30th. There have been two Martale Encirclements. The First Martale Encirclements was after &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; was liberated cutting of access to &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Adamant Resolve and ended when Matar Bay was reinvaded by the Automatons 1 month after they left. The Second Martale Encirclements was after Matar Bay was liberated again cutting of access from Cyberstan, the encirclement has not been broken and Enemy Resistance on Martale has remained at 0.00%.

As such, Super Earth High Command would issue an order to the Helldivers to quarantine the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff Sector&lt;/a&gt; and conduct immediate eradication operations on Socorro III, as it faced the greatest Terminid onslaught of the war so far.\nThis would be the first time that Super Earth's scientists would spot &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "3256", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3256", "title": "Erata Prime", "text": "Erata Prime is one of the four planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Its general landscape consists of barren deserts and exhausting heat.\nTopography.\nErata Prime is the hottest survivable planet in the Umlaut Sector. The terrain alternates between vast stretches of sand and rocks. Most local flora comes in the form of dry grasses and prickly, unpleasant bushes. Frequent sandstorms decrease visibility to unacceptable levels. Citizens are advised to stay wary of occasional seismic activity, which may slow movement or cause injuries.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nErata Prime was overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the engagements that preceded the Second Galactic War. Thankfully for democracy, the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt; in March 2184 gave the Helldivers access to the FTL lines past &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to begin liberating Erata from the tyrannical bugs.\nDeployment of the Terminid Control System.\nErata Prime, alongside the rest of the planets in the Umlaut Sector, was selected for deployment a new type of containment measure against the bugs: the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;. The TCS was a complex of chemical dispersion towers that were designed to spread the newly-made Termicide, an anti-fascist neurotoxin that could kill off the invading insects without damaging the rest of the planet's biomass.\nAfter the planet was liberated and the deployment of the TCS System was completed, Erata Prime would remain firmly under Super Earth's stewardship with little incident, allowing the Helldivers to refocus their efforts on the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; Front.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nUnfortunately, the Terminids didn't allow that peace to last. Shortly after the start of the Automaton Reclamation of Cyberstan, the TCS failed. Not only had the Termicide become ineffective against the bugs, it was also causing them to mutate, allowing the Terminids on the Barrier Planets to reproduce up to 20 times faster than usual. Before the SEAF could react, the neighboring planet &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; was overrun and turned into a Terminid Supercolony. Luckily, the Helldivers' swift deactivation of the TCS prevented Erata Prime, and the other planets in the Umlaut System, from a similar fate.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFrom the moment the TCS failed, all planets close to Meridia began to face ceaseless assaults by the alien menace throughout the months of April and May 2184. For several weeks, Erata Prime endured the horrors of the tragedy brought on by the insectoid scourge, while Super Earth High Command valiantly scrambled for a solution to its quarrels.\nFinally, after the declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny, Super Earth's leaders began to commission the Ministry of Science to manufacture a new type of super-weapon in order to destroy Meridia. After some weeks of research, scientists at &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; managed to produce vast quantities of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon of planetary destruction seized from the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nOn May 28, 2184, Super Earth High Command gave the order to destroy Meridia, first by liberating all planets that could connect Moradesh to Meridia and then, from May 29 to May 30, deploying the Dark Fluid directly onto Meridia's surface. By the afternoon of May 30, enough Dark Fluid had accumulated in Meridia to reach critical mass and, subsequently, collapse the Supercolony into a black hole. This heroic act siphoned away all of the mutated spores that the Supercolony was emitting, effectively crippling the Terminid advance to a halt.\nOperation Destiny Manifested.\nImmediately after Operation Enduring Peace, orders were given out for the SEAF to retake all of the planets that had been initially assaulted by the Terminids due to the Supercolony's augmentative effect. These planets included &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt; and Erata Prime. Judicious deployment of the Helldivers was instrumental in the operation's success, which allowed Super Earth citizens to finally reclaim the homes they had been forced to abandon.\nInterim prior to Operation Prometheus.\nHowever, the citizens of Erata Prime would not be able to fully resettle their sufficient sized homes in peace. Even with all the victories of Super Earth at both the Terminid and Automaton fronts, Erata Prime would still be attacked by Terminids and fall to their control for a short period of time, but would be liberated shortly after, as the Terminids still were battered from the loss of the Supercolony.\nOperation Prometheus.\nHowever, Erata Prime wouldn't remain free for long. With the apparition of the Gloom in early August 2184, Terminid offensives surged as the fascist nebula expanded without control. Erata Prime would be attacked in two occasions after the apparition of the Gloom, once on August 14th and once on August 27th, with both attacks being successfully repelled and serving to stop the growth of the Gloom beyond the barrier planets.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nFollowing its final defense on August 27th, Erata Prime wouldn't see much more combat, as the Terminids would turn their focus farther south towards the Jin Xi Sector. From August to November, Erata Prime spent its time rebuilding and fortifying, as it was still laying right at the edge of the Gloom. However, once the Terminid Research Preserve was completed and defended, the Terminids began to shift their focus once more. On November 5th, amidst a spore surge originated in the Gloom a week prior, Erata Prime would be attacked in tandem with &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and Fenrir III. However, with the intensity of the attacks, the Helldivers weren't able to safeguard all 3 fronts. After the defense of Fenrir III, Estanu was given priority in its defense over Erata, as its proximity to Crimsica and the Terminid Research Preserve made it too risky to lose.\nThis would result in Erata Prime having to be abandoned and lost to the Terminids on November 6th, its colonists having to relocate to &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt; for immediate transfer to the Democracy Space Station.\nHowever, hope was not lost for Erata Prime. Once the Terminids were repelled in Crimsica, the intensity of Terminid assaults decreased, freeing up certain helldivers to help with the planet's liberation. However, the Terminids displayed horrendous ferocity and resistance, which meant that little progress would be achieved until, on November 9th, the last Terminid assault was repelled on Bore Rock, which left the Terminid hatcheries depleted and left Erata Prime in a more manageable state.\nGiven Erata Prime's past history in the Barrier Planets, Erata Prime was pretty much unanimously picked as a primary liberation target and, from November 8th to November 10th, the Helldivers would tirelessly fight to liberate it, successfully dislodging the Terminids of its surface by the late evening of November 10th.\nOperation Wormhole Spaghetti.\nErata Prime would remain untouched after its liberation in November. However, it would barely spend a month free before being captured by the Terminids on December 21st, amidst both a Terminid offensive and the return of the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; to the galaxy, which triggered a crisis on the southern sectors. Yet despite this, it would seem that Erata Prime would be on a streak of good luck as, during its defense, Super Earth High Command issued a major order calling for both Erata Prime and Fenrir III to be controlled for the following 3 days, guaranteeing the availability of the Helldivers for its liberation."}

It wouldn't be until June 2184 that the war would come to its coarse doorstep. Shortly after the fall of nearby Esker on June 20th, the Terminids continued to spread into the Falstaff Sector, quickly hopping onto Erson Sands and making landfall on June 21st.\nThe battle is would be brief, as the Helldivers had higher priorities to focus their manpower on. Erson Sands would fall on June 21st to a feeble Terminid Assault\nFalstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nDuring the lockdown of the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, Erson Sands was one of the 5 planets picked to be controlled by the Helldivers, the other 4 being &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion XXIV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt;. While the liberation of the 3 latter planets would be straightforward, with only a couple anomalous assaults being even worthy of any mention, Erson Sands would remain elusive for the entire duration of the operation, as it was locked away behind the capture of Esker, another planet in which the bugs had deeply burrowed themselves.\nNevertheless, the Helldivers would overcome all hurdles and finally initiate the battle to liberate Erson Sands on the early hours of July 2nd. By the midnight of July 3rd, Erson Sands had been liberated.\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation.\nHowever, Erson Sands wasn't fated to remain free for long just yet. Due to constant diversions prying Helldivers away, the Terminids would manage to send an second assault onto Esker, managing to invade it and then, almost immediately after, take over Bore Rock. From here, the Terminids would amass their numbers at Esker and, on August 6th, they launched a massive assault onto Socorro III, forcing the Helldivers to rush back to Socorro to deal with the massive Terminid onslaught. However, the bugs would prove to have a more devious plan than thought as, on August 7th, they launched a secondary assault onto Erson Sands, creating an FTL Line into it from &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;.\nErson Sands would fall in August 7th, leaving it at the mercy of the bugs. However, its colonists would find solace in the fact that Socorro managed to repel its own Terminid superonslaught just hours later, in part thanks to their sacrifices. A liberation campaign would be attempted to avenge the courageous defenders, but would fail as &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, a newly discovered nebula composed of massive concentrations of intergalactic Terminid spores, would encroach upon it, bolstering the Terminids nestled in the planet and, for the time being, covering the planet in such a thick cloud of spores that SEAF satellites wouldn't be able to continue monitoring the planet.\nThe situation of Erson Sands ever since has been unknown. As of October 3rd only two Super Destroyer signals were left in Orbit of Erson's Sands, the last Super Destroyer from Erson Sands tried hailing both before successfully blind jumping out of the Erson System. The hails were not answered and the Super Destroyers were silent, the Crew of the escaping destroyer came close to one them and saw the gloom cloud having entered the destroyer through an open hanger bay, this indicates a failure on the part of said Destroyer's crew to secure the hangar doors which resulted in a airlock breach and ill timing on part of the Eagle Pilot who tried to beat the cloud to get back to the Destroyer. The other Destroyer was operational but suffered an Engine Malfunction leaving it adrift at least until it either floats away or falls onto Erson Sands itself. Whatever the case both are still transmitting faint signals for now."}

This planet, alongside &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt;, marks the border between the Falstaff and &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, as it contains an FTL line with &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nThe planet is covered by a sickly moor, characterized by it's high temperatures and abundant toxic fumes, which seep up from the planets crust, bearing an eerie resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nEsker had been sitting on the sideline of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; front unscathed, as war raged on in the neighboring Mirin Sector from February 2184 onwards. However, it soon would become inevitably engulfed by the raging conflict. As the Helldivers righteously approached &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes of crushing all of its bug hives by use of drilled nuclear bombs, the hives on the ashen planet emitted intergalactic spores beyond their usual level and quickly reached Esker as a means to ensure their continued survival.\nThe Terminid outbreak made landfall in the late hours of the afternoon of June 18th, with the calls for defense mounting. However, early analysis predicted that, due to the required focus on the &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; offensive and the subsequent Nivel 43 offensive, Esker's defense was going to be unsuccessful.\nBy the late hours of June 19th, Esker's defense had failed, immediately leading to a liberation campaign on it, leaving it stuck in a bloody deadlock that only produced dead colonists and bugs alike.\nOperation Falstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nEsker would remain captured for the rest of the month of June. Then, in July, Super Earth High Command issued a major order mandating the liberation of Bore Rock, Erson Sands, &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion XXIV&lt;/a&gt;. While Esker wasn't part of the objective planets, it was the one planet blocking access to Erson Sands, which meant that it would have to be liberated regardless. By July 2nd, after several hurdles, it would be liberated, allowing the Helldivers through.\nOperation Andromeda.\nHowever, Esker would not enjoy its freedom for long. As the Helldivers were ordered away to the Automaton front once more, Esker would be left underdefended and the bugs, repeating their strategy from their first attempts, sent a spore barrage from Nivel 43 to Esker. Due to the higher priority of the Automaton threat, Esker fell alongside &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; in a double assault.\nOperation Benevolent Santitation.\nEsker remained under Terminid control for the remainder of July, as the Helldivers were kept away from the Terminid front in order to crush the Automaton encirclement. However, a new development in the Eastern front would force the Helldivers back. With the appearance of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, an unusual nebula of Intergalactic Terminid Spores, around &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt;, the colonists at nearby Socorro III would send a call for aid, reporting new Terminid variants incoming from Esker, as a massive Terminid onslaught attempted an invasion of the planet. As such, the Helldivers would be diverted back towards the Terminid front, with orders to liberate Esker and Bore Rock, as well as to conduct eradication operations on Socorro III.\nEsker was liberated on August 8th, shortly after Socorro's onslaught was successfully repelled and the eradication operations were finished successfully. \nOperation Brute Force.\nEsker would finally see a time of relative peace after its liberation. However, while its colonists began to rebuild, the war began to loom upon its surface once again. Shortly after the rescue of Socorro III, the Gloom began to expand, shrouding Erson Sands and slowly growing to encompass more and more planets while making the Terminids mutate further. Esker remained in a dubious peace for most of August until, in August 25th, the Terminids in Nivel 43, now being bolstered by the Gloom's effect, sent a barrage of Terminid spores upon it. With the Helldivers having been ordered back to the Terminid Front after their successful victory during Operation's Lighthouse and People's Shield, Esker's defense would see its ranks filled with Helldivers and brave colonists alike.\nEsker would be successfuly defended by the end of the day, just as the Helldivers managed to finally liberate &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV.&lt;/a&gt;\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nEsker would remain in a relative peace following its final defense in August, with not much events of note happening since, as the Terminids shifted their focus towards Gatria and the Jin Xi sector amidst the start of the Democracy Space Station project. However, this peace was not going to last for much longer. Having been seemingly contained, the Terminids began to focus their assaults back towards the westernmost planets on the front, with Socorro III and Esker standing right at the edge of the Gloom.\nAs such, on November 4th, the Terminids sent out an attack from within the Gloom towards both Socorro and Esker. Unable to save both planets, the Helldivers opted to aid Esker's defense against the Terminids, with the assault finally being repelled on November 5th.\nHowever, this wouldn't be the final attack. A day later, on November 6th, the Terminids launched another triple attack against Esker, &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and Bore Rock, pretty much immediately after the triple attack against &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven Bore Rock's strategic importance, it was chosen after Heeth to be defended by the Helldivers, leaving Esker to its own devices. Esker would fall on November 7th, the Helldivers being unable to save it due to the Terminids launched a dual assault onto &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and Estanu.\nOn November 28th, 2184, Bore Rock was attacked by the Terminids, and 2 days later, it unfortunately fell as the Helldivers did not prioritize its defense. With this, Esker's supply lines all led to Terminid space, locking its access away for the time-being, forcing trapped colonists to flee to bunkers and hide from the wrath of the tyrannic bugs.\nOperation Crop Dust.\nOn December 5th, 2184, orders were given to liberate Esker, along with &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; on the western front, all of which are locked behind enemy lines. Such mentioned planets have been identified as being rich in salt-mines, which is needed in order to rectify the shortage of chlorine and finally commence the production of MD-8 Gas Mines and its requisition to all Super Destroyers. &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt;, which was the only roadblock in the path to Esker's liberation, was liberated on December 7th, 2184, starting the battle to retake the acidic desert world. The battle lasted 2 days and on December 9th, 2184, the caustic planet was finally retaken from the tyrannical bugs, fulfilling 1/3 targets for the major order.\nOperation Wormhole Spaghetti.\nEsker would not be able to spend much time free nor in peace. As the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; made their resurgence, the Helldivers had to divert manpower towards the new front in the southern sectors which, consequently, further depleted their available forces to fight the Terminids, who quickly capitalized on the occasion with their own offensive.\nOn December 22nd, the Terminids would send an attack onto Esker from within the Gloom. With the Helldivers busy both with the Illuminate and the ongoing operation at the Umlaut Sector, Esker was left to mostly fend for itself."}

It is the planet to have seen the most combat out of any others in the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; front, with a total of 14 successful defense operations (of which 7 have been part of Major Orders), 6 victorious liberation campaigns (of which 3 have been part of Major Orders) and an infamous 5 consecutive successful defences during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Rampart\"&gt;Operation Enduring Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, a feat only replicated by &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Overrun.\nTopography.\nEstanu is a cold, hostile planet. Its surface consists of large, snow-covered regions, broken up by rocky mountains and crevasses. The planet's surface is windswept and barren. It has little flora, with only small patches of plant life able to withstand the winds and frigid temperatures.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOperation CBCT Protection.\nMerely days after the successul deployment of the Terminid Control System (TCS) on the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, several Civilian Biomass Collection Teams (BCTs) were deployed to Estanu, &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; in order to collect and process inert Terminids. The Helldivers successfully liberated and defended each of these planets until operation completion.\nOperation Rearing.\nFollowing Operation CBCT Protection, Estanu remained relatively peaceful outside of small-scale Terminid raids.\nFollowing the success of Operation Swift Disassembly and the eradication of the Automaton Expeditionary Forces, Helldivers were re-routed to this planet, alongside with Hellmire and Crimsica, in order to build safer, more efficient E-710 farms and refineries.\nInvasion of Cyberstan.\nWhen the Automatons resurged in the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, SEAF forces had to be diverted away from the Terminid front, leaving Estanu and the rest of the Draco sector under-defended. Despite this shortage of manpower, the colonial defenses stood against the Terminid raids, resilient in their commitment to protecting the spread of Freedom.\nOperation Organic Harvest.\nAs the war against the Automatons raged on in the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;, logistical challenges began to emerge. The righteous campaigns of the Helldivers had depleted Super Earth's E-710 reserves down to untolerable levels. As such, Super Earth High Command issued an order to exterminate 2,000,000,000 Terminids through the week of April 14 - April 20, 2184, in order to replenish the depleted reserves. The Helldivers, boundless in their loyalty and commitment to the cause of Liberty, managed to accomplish this order in under 24 hours, making it one of the fastest operations in Super Earth History.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; hereby reminds the reader that any rumours of \"accounting errors in the kill-count\" are the result of Automaton-sponsored dissidents and can be safely disregarded. Reporting any and all dissemination of these rumours to your local Democracy Officers is highly encouraged\nOperation Enduring Bulwark.\nImmediately after the replenishing of the E-710 reserves, the Terminids, in a cowardly demonstration of treachery and evil innate to their species, managed to launch a coordinated assault on Super Earth-controlled planets alongside the Automaton assault on their respective front. The battle was fierce, with the heroic personnel on Estanu withstanding 5 consecutive assaults.\nDespite massive losses and countless heroic sacrifices, the Helldivers valiantly defended their positions against the massive onslaughts on both fronts, securing Estanu firmly into Democracy's protection.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nShortly after Operation Enduring Bulwark came to an end, the Terminid Control System began to cause dangerous mutations on the Terminid populations of the Barrier Planets. As &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Terminid tide and became a Supercolony, chaos spread to the neighboring planets of the Umlaut Sector and into Estanu. While it has been spared the fate of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the deactivation of the TCS infrastructure in the Umlaut Sector, Estanu fell to the Terminid onslaught, alongside the rest of the Draco Sector.\nThe Ministry of Humanity requests that all citizens set aside one minute of silence during lunch breaks in remembrance of all the lives lost on Estanu.\nSecond Galactic War.\nDuring the first weeks of the Second Galactic War, Estanu remained under Terminid control, enduring horrendous cruelty brought onto it by the bugs. However, their toil was not going to go unheard for much longer. Scientists on &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; were beginning to prepare experimental Dark Fluid for deployment on Meridia. A decision was reached to deploy the Dark Fluid and collapse Meridia into a Black Hole.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nOperation Enduring Peace began on May 28th, 2184 and concluded on the afternoon of June 2nd, 2184, with Meridia being successfully destroyed. Without the Supercolony and with the black hole now siphoning away all of the remaining supercolony spores, new fronts began to immediately open, with Estanu and Crimsica now being open for liberation once more.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nWith the securing of Database One in &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; and the valiant rescue of the trapped children in Super Citizen Anne's Hospital for the Very Sick Children at &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, Super Earth High Command now had more breathing room to divert manpower back against the Terminids. Even though the Supercolony had been destroyed, Terminid population levels remained at unmanageable levels, demanding an unsustainable cost of lives and munitions for its adequate containment. As such, a Major Order was given out on June 14th to liberate Hellmire, &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, and all 3 planets in the Draco Sector (Estanu, Crimsica and Fori Prime). Crimsica was liberated first on June 16th, with Estanu quickly following on June 17th after a quick but devastating battle.\nOperation Andromeda.\nHowever, Estanu's liberty would be short lived. With Fori Prime failing to be secured, Estanu's colonists were living on borrowed time. One by one, slowly but surely, the Terminids in Fori Prime would take back all the planets lost. First &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt;, from which they would then go on to infest the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Crimsica during Operation Starslayer. And then, on July 13th, Estanu once more. Due to the ongoing Operation Andromeda, the Helldivers were unable to answer to its call for aid and, understandably, it fell to the Terminid assault.\nTerminid Research Initiative.\nWhile under Terminid occupation, the Helldivers would deploy onto Estanu in order to carry out the Terminid Research Initiative, which would yield very positive results and data for the Ministry of Science. While the Terminids at Estanu did react by launching a failed assault onto Fenrir III, not much else of note would occur\nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nHowever, the Terminid Research Initiative would not be the only time during which Estanu, despite its occupation, would see action. As the Terminid Research Initiative shifted into a second stage, it mandated the culling of 1 billion Terminids through several different methods. As such, the Helldivers would valiantly charge into Terminid territory, in order to carry out the Ministry of Science's request. They would successfully cull the required amount of Terminids and push them out of the Jin Xi Sector after a bloody counteroffensive at Acamar and the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly allowed the Helldivers to redirect to Estanu and progress its liberation considerably before being ordered back towards the Automaton Front.\nOperation Vengeful Cleansing.\nDespite Estanu; or for that matter, planetary liberations, not being the specific target of the Major Order, the Helldivers would wind up liberating Estanu during Operation Vengeful Cleansing, making such an efficient, effective and impeccable usage of land mines and combined arms tactics that the Terminids would be eradicated from the planet by the evening of August 4th.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nEstanu would remain free since August 4th. However, being free almost never means being safe from the menace of tyranny. As The Gloom appeared in Enuliale, Estanu's colonists would see their home threatened once again. On August 13th, shortly after the liberation of Troost in the Western Front and the victory at Acamar IV, the Terminids would launch a dual assault onto Estanu and &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;. Given Estanu's reputation, the majority of the Helldivers concentrated on the defense of Estanu, repelling the Terminid attack in under 12 hours.\nOperation Prometheus.\nHowever, the Bugs would not be done with their push towards Estanu as, a mere 12 hours after their first failed assault, they launched a second, even more reinforced assault onto Estanu. However, now that the Helldivers had order to focus on sample collection tasks on Crimsica, &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, it was unlikely that Estanu will be able to successfully defend itself. However, in a sprout of good luck, Operation Prometheus would be aborted, as counterfeit samples would be encountered within the deliveries of the ordered samples.\nWith the major order aborted, the Helldivers could redirect forces towards rescuing Estanu, as many in the corps had a noticeable emotional investment into the planet. In detriment of the liberation of Crimsica, the Helldivers shifted towards Estanu and turned around the situation, securing its freedom once more.\nOperation Brute Force.\nEstanu would remain secured against the bugs after the liberation of Crimsica, with the only attack coming towards it being from Fori Prime on August 25th. In honor of all the Helldivers lost to Estanu so far, the Helldivers rushed to defend Estanu and managed to repel the assault during the night of August 26th, which began a courageous string of victories during the operation, having first started with the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; before this.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nEstanu would remain in peace for 2 months after its final defense on August 26th, as the Gloom stabilized and stopped its expansion. However, its safety was not guaranteed, as it stood at the very edge of the Gloom, leaving it vulnerable to attacks from both Fori Prime and Hellmire. Yet, despite this, Estanu was not attacked for 2 whole months, as the Terminids focused on aggressively expanding into the Jin Xi sector.\nHowever, this status would soon change, as, on October 16th, both Crimsica and Estanu would be attacked from within The Gloom. Since Crimsica was the planet connected to Acamar IV, Estanu was essentially abandoned to its own devices. Despite this, the colonists at Estanu fought valiantly against the evil insectoids, determined to drive back the fascist tide that pounced upon their sufficiently sized dwellings. However, it was all for naught, as the Helldivers were forced to completely concentrate on Crimsica, leaving Estanu abandoned and letting it fall to the Terminids on October 17th.\nDespite this, the Helldivers would not abandon Estanu, maintaining a sizeable force on the planet in order to ensure its swift liberation. Estanu would wind up being liberated shortly after the defense of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, with the last terminid hives being effectively cleansed on October 22nd. \nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nAfter October 22nd, Estanu would remain mostly peaceful, with not many incidents worthy of note occurring. However, following a surge of Terminid spores, the Terminids inside the Gloom would launch a massive offensive, just as Super Earth had begun mobilizing volunteers from Gloom-adjacent planets in order to staff the Democracy Space Station. As such, the Helldivers were ordered to hold the line while these millions of volunteers were processed and transported to the DSS.\nEstanu would find itself back in the frontlines on November 5th, as a Terminid attack from within the Gloom made landfall on it, alongside &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;. After Fenrir III was defended, Estanu would enjoy the help of the Helldiver Corps in its defense, to the detriment of Erata Prime's own defense which lead to a victory in Estanu on November 6th, at the cost of losing Erata Prime to the Terminids yet again. \nHowever, this would not be the last time Estanu would be attacked. After another triple assault, this time at Heeth, &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Estanu would once again be attacked, along with Crimsica. The Helldivers decided to start by helping Estanu's defense first, which would allow the Terminids to make crucial gains at Crimsica. The Helldivers would fight tooth and nail to defend Estanu against the Terminids, as both assaults were unusually fierce.\nAfter some 17 hours of fighting, Estanu was secured, which allowed the Helldivers to initiate immediate redeployments on Crimsica."}

It serves as a form of tower-defense mode where the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; hold a defensive line against an onslaught of hostiles while several rockets filled with Helldivers in cryo-sleep get sent to orbit.\nGameplay.\nThe mission begins with the Helldivers dropping to the designated area as they are given 1 minute and 30 seconds to set up their defensive positions; this can be bypassed by manually activating the evacuation via a button panel near the rocket launch pad. The general layout consists of several blast doors that can be manually opened and closed in a tight path that leads to the evacuation rockets. These blast doors act as a form of barrier to help keep the enemy out as they would have to destroy it to get past it, backing up enemy traffic and making them easy targets to obliterate. Multiple &lt;a href=\"E/MG-101%20HMG%20Emplacement\"&gt;HMG turrets&lt;/a&gt; can be found on walls that can be utilized against the attacking forces, however they have limited ammunition so it's advised to use them wisely.\nThe primary objective is to hold the onslaught back until all rockets have been sent to orbit, from there the Helldivers are tasked with an immediate evacuation order and are extracted via &lt;a href=\"Pelican-1\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. The enemy's main goal is to break through the Helldiver's defenses and destroy two exposed generators that power the evacuation rockets that lie underground. If they are destroyed, the mission is considered an absolute failure and the Helldivers are forced to either extract or die."}

{"id": "3894", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3894", "title": "FTL Lines", "text": "FTL Lines, or Supply Lines, are a galactic network or interstellar pathways that Super Earth and their enemies use to travel across the galaxy. Additionally, FTL is the abbreviation for Faster Than Light.\nPrior to patch 01.000.400, FTL Supply Lines weren't visible on the in-game Galactic War Map, with the only ways of knowing them being community-made apps like &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.helldivers.io\"&gt;helldivers.io&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//helldiverscompanion.com\"&gt;helldiverscompanion.com&lt;/a&gt;, which showed datamined supply line data.\nAfter patch 1.000.400, FTL Supply Line dynamics were implemented into the game, alongside with a whole new FTL Network while also making them visible on the in-game map.\nBasic Mechanics.\nFTL Supply Lines are the only ways in which players and playable enemy factions alike can travel from planet to planet. As such, it is crucial to understand their functioning.\nPlanets can dynamically change the number of FTL supply lines they have, as both enemy factions can open new FTL lines into planets that Helldivers may have locked down, as displayed during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Xzar%20Lockdown\"&gt;Operation Xzar Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, in which the created a new FTL Supply line from &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt; to send an assault onto the planet, and Operation Benevolent Sanitation, during which the created an FTL Supply line from &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt; to send an assault onto the planet.\nOn average, planets intended to be accessible to players have anywhere from 2 to 4 FTL Lines with other planets, with the only exceptions to this rule being the planets &lt;a href=\"Zosma\"&gt;Zosma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demiurg\"&gt;Demiurg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barabos\"&gt;Barabos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slif\"&gt;Slif&lt;/a&gt;, the first two getting their FTL Lines on October and November while the latter two got an FTL Supply Line on February 8th. Other planets with less than 2 FTL Lines are Tibit, Merak, Aurora Bay, Azur Secundus and Navi VII, the first one having gotten its FTL Supply Line during the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Mass%20Automaton%20Attack\"&gt;Automaton Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the second and third being part of the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and falling under Automaton control during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23The%20Reclamation\"&gt;The Reclamation&lt;/a&gt;, and the last two falling to Terminid control during the initial Terminid Outbreak in February 2024. \nEnemies can only create supply lines that connect adjacent sectors and can only cross through 1 point of a border between sectors. This is best displayed in the triple border between the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, as even though there is a lot of empty space between the planets of &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons never attempted to push towards Wasat from either Martale or Varylia 5 during Operation Starslayer, even though they had control over both planets even after Meissa had been liberated shortly before Vega Bay was captured by the Automatons. The only known exception to this rule is the FTL Supply Line connecting Mastia and &lt;a href=\"Fenmire\"&gt;Fenmire&lt;/a&gt;, which are both part of the same Sector. The FTL Supply Line connecting Mastia and Fenmire goes through a very small corner gap in the south portion of the Talus Sector, making it the only known FTL Supply Line to break the previously mentioned rule of supply lines only being able to cross one border once.\nIt is also worth pointing out that FTL lines can never intersect with one another.\nEnemy factions will only attempt to create FTL supply lines if they don't have control over any existing FTL lines but have a planet within the general vicinity of a planet controlled by Super Earth. This was recently displayed during Operation Overrun, in which the Terminids would launch an assault from &lt;a href=\"Trandor\"&gt;Trandor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;, as Gatria was only connected to Phact Bay, which was under Super Earth control prior to the operation, during which it got attacked and put into a defense.\nEnemies can create more than one supply line, but will only be able to use 1 when sending an assault, with the preferrence appearing to be using FTL lines that were already existent. This was also displayed during Operation Overrun, during which the Terminids also launched an assault from &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion XXIV&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt; but still created an FTL Line from &lt;a href=\"Partion\"&gt;Partion&lt;/a&gt; to Phact Bay, in order to send a second assault once the assault from Pandion XXIV was repelled.\nOnce FTL Supply Lines have been created, they can not be cut during regular gameplay, with their removal seemingly requiring developer input. This could be noticed during certain operations in the Terminid front, in which planets like &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt; would gain and lose their FTL supply lines but never became accessible before Operation Jin Xi-Falstaff Lockdown. \nEnemy factions can only create FTL lines and launch assaults from planets under their control that are below a still unknown threshold of liberation. This was showcased during Operation Brute Force, in which the Terminids in &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; never attempted an attack onto neighboring &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; being under Terminid control. This was also showcased during Operation Ecologic Immolation, during which the Automatons only attempted their invasions of &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; once the liberation progress on recently liberated &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; had gone below 1%. The highest amount of liberation at which enemies can launch attacks is at 50%, the starting amount of liberation of any planet in which their respective defense has been failed, however, enemies will often wait some hours after capturing a planet before sending out attacks from said planet.\nWhenever a Major Order explicitly defines its objective to be the defense of a specific planet or planets, enemy factions will attack said target planets as frequently as possible, regardless of the amount of liberation in the planet they launch an attack from. This can happen even if the Major Order is focused on only one faction, as demonstrated by how the Automatons sent an attack from Shelt to Shallus during Operation Alcubierre-II despite Shelt being at 70%\nThis was best displayed during Operation Titanium Belt, during which the Automatons attacked &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; 2 times in a row once shortly after had captured &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;, while it still had around 35% liberation. First attack happened once they captured Gaellivare and was done in conjunction with an attack at &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt;. After this first attack at Imber was repelled, the Automatons then attacked &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shallus\"&gt;Shallus&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously, with both attacks being repelled. After this dual attack, Imber was attacked again alongside &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt;. It is worth noting that Operation Titanium Belt only lasted 3 days, meaning that the rate of enemy attacks could also be influenced by operation duration.\nAnother display of this exception happened during Operation Alcubierre-II, during which the Terminids at Acamar IV launched an assault onto Turing despite Acamar being at 70% liberation.\nAdditionally, extra supply lines can be created by Super Earth during Major Orders. This can be noticed best in &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt;, which has 4 FTL Supply Lines connected to it despite never being attacked. This is because, during Operation Enduring Peace, the Helldivers were tasked with protecting Heeth and Angel's Venture, which were stated to serve as paths towards Meridia in order to deploy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, despite being capable to creating FTL Lines, Super Earth will not create new FTL Lines during regular Galactic Map gameplay, most likely to prevent the players from pushing enemy factions back too quickly. This was best demonstrated during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Jin%20Xi-Falstaff%20Lockdown\"&gt;Operation Jin Xi-Falstaff Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, during which an FTL line from Erata Prime to Bore Rock was not created despite both planets being close to one another and being in adjacent sectors.\nIt is also worth noting that changes in planet control won't always immediately transfer through FTL Lines. This was recently displayed during Operation Overrun, in which Trandor didn't immediately open for liberation despite Gatria's defense being successful, with Trandor only opening once it sent in a second attack onto Gatria hours after the first defense.\nGambits.\nA \"Gambit\" is a term used to describe the ocurrence of Helldivers successfully liberating a planet from which an attack going onto another planet is originating from. This was best displayed during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Enduring%20Bulwark\"&gt;Operation Enduring Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, during which the Helldivers liberated &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt; while the Terminids there attempted to invade &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the liberation of Oshaune and the immediate victory of the Fori Prime defense.\nAnother example of a successful Helldiver Gambit was shown during Operation Xzar Lockdown, during which the Helldivers liberated &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; while the Automatons garrisoned there attacked &lt;a href=\"P%C3%B6pli%20IX\"&gt;P\u00f6pli IX&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the defense in P\u00f6pli to be won as a result. As well, during Operation People's Shield, the Helldivers managed to liberate &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; while the Automatons there were attempting to attack Tarsh, which resulted in Tarsh's defense succeeding.\nHowever, this can also happen in reverse, as shown during the Third Battle of &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; on March 30th, 2184, in which the Automatons managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; before Ubanea could be fully liberated, which prevented the completion of its liberation campaign, as its only other supply lines led to &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; and Tibit, both of which were under Automaton control at the time.\nAnother example of Gambits being inflicted upon the Helldivers happened during the First Battle of &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; on April 20th, 2184, in which the Automatons managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; before the Helldivers could finish liberating Martale, which prevented its liberation from succeeding, as both &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; were under Automaton control at the time."}

They heavily resemble the from Helldivers 1, but it is still unconfirmed what relationship they may have with the exactly. However, it can be assumed that the Automatons were created by the Cyborgs in order to wage war against Super Earth once again.\nThe Automatons are focused on more conventional military tactics, relying on artillery and firepower to engage and kill Helldivers from a distance. When engaging with the Automatons, the best approach can be to find cover and shoot or to strike and scatter, so long as neither tactic ends up extending the fight for too long before the enemy fire inevitably overwhelms the players.\n\"For more information, consult the article on the Illuminate by clicking the title above\"\nThe are an alien species dedicated to xenophobia and mysticism, preying on innocent frontier colonists to mutate and brainwash them into hordes of mindless slaves.

Due to their functionality, it is unsurprising that Automatons can quickly deploy and spread on Super Earth colonies. \nFactory Striders are extremely tough targets, with many Helldivers reporting they can survive several 500kg bomb direct hits. \nOn April 16th, Reports confirmed that the Factory Striders encountered during the latter stages of Operation Swift Disassembly were prototypes on test runs and are now being mass-produced.

Super Earth follows a system of government called Managed Democracy, in which citizens must fill out a form from which an AI will take the answers and produce who you truly want to vote for. The population of the Federation is centered around &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, with small colonial outposts scattered about the Galaxy. The &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Super Earth Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; (SEAF) have billions of active personal and an elite &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers Corp&lt;/a&gt;, millions strong.\nGalactic Geography.\nThe Federation spans billions, if not trillions of kilometers of the Milky Way, split up into 55 Sectors. The size of the sectors and number of planets inside of them vary. The sectors furthest away from Super Earth have a larger distance between planets, but have around the same amount of planets as ones next to Super Earth. The abundant amounts of resources owned by the Federation grows the industrial capability and fuels the colonization of the galaxy.\n&lt;a href=\"Biomes\"&gt;Biomes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Federation is home to many exotic biomes with many different life forms. Super Earth has observed 20 different biomes inside of their borders. \nColonial Outposts.\nOn nearly every planet on the Galactic Frontier, colonial outposts are inhabited by Super Earth citizens and are established by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt;. These outposts are the lifeline of future expansion of Managed Democracy and are seen as a major priority by the SEAF, which has dedicated many troops to these areas of space. The outposts mostly consist of cutting-edge facilities inhabited by the bravest, strongest and most capable members of the Federation.\nUrban Colonies.\nOn some economically successful planets, such as &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kerth%20Secundus\"&gt;Kerth Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mog\"&gt;Mog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Prime\"&gt;Genesis Prime&lt;/a&gt; among others, many urbanized settlements have been built, complete with streets, parks, tall apartment buildings, offices, working electricity, water and waste management infrastructure, Anti-Air Defenses, SEAF Artillery Batteries and all the commodities expected in urban life. These thriving worlds are among the most shining examples of the prosperity that Managed Democracy can bring to all the worlds it touches.\nHistory.\nThe Great War.\nThe Great War, or the Third World War, was a nuclear conflict that reduced the majority of the Northern Hemisphere into a radioactive wasteland. It is unknown when the war occurred, but it was likely sometime between the years 2015 and 2044. The war was presumably between two superpowers, most likely the United States of America and China and their allies. Russia and the United Kingdom were almost entirely destroyed during the nuclear exchange, along with sections of Alaska and Canada. However, the United States of America and China survived, seemingly unscathed.\nProclamation of the Federation of Super Earth.\nAfter the presumed collapse of social order as a result of the worldwide destruction caused by the Great War, the world was left in a state of disarray, with abundant misinformation, disinformation, and information, causing a state of \"democratic anarchy\". Amidst this anarchy, a new idea emerged as the Democratic Council came together to form a new government and publish the first and final draft of a new way forward for mankind: Managed Democracy. This council went on to form a new globe-spanning government and would gain control of what remained of Earth. They then proclaimed the birth of the greatest nation in Human history, the Federation of Super Earth.\nFirst Contact and the First Galactic War.\nIn the year 2044, as humanity began to venture into space thanks to the invention of the Alcubierre Drive a decade prior, they came into contact with two hostile alien species: the and The . First contact turned sour and war broke out. Another front eventually opened up with the , socialists who disagreed with the ways of Managed Democracy and were subsequently outcast to a barren snowy wasteland of a planet, which they named &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;. To survive these harsh conditions, the Cyborgs replaced their body parts with cybernetic implants. After detonating a massive bomb on a Super Earth city-planet, killing thousands, they were brought into war with the Federation. After 40 years, the Galactic War raged on until Super Earth began enlisting highly elite solders called &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt;. Within just 40 days of the Helldivers entering the war, all enemies of Managed Democracy were defeated in a decisive Super Earth Victory. The Bugs were relegated into farms to be contained, bred, and harvested for E-710. The Cyborgs were enfranchised in the mines of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, and The were driven from the galaxy.\nThe Great Democratization.\nAfter the swift victory of Super Earth at the end of the First Galactic War in 2084, the Federation had become the New Galactic Order, unquestioned across the stars. FTL technology that had been liberated from the The during the war was now used to colonize the galaxy in the name of Super Earth. This period would be come to be named as the \"The Great Democratization\". For 100 years, this period of peace, freedom and democracy allowed Humanity to expand and develop. FTL travel required E-710, so &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; farms were created to safely contain them and harvest the E-710 that they produce at an industrial scale. \nSecond Galactic War.\nOn February 8th, 2184, two massive simultaneous attacks on the Federation took place. To the East, the , now , broke out of their farms and wreaked havoc on the colonists living there. , robotic machines resembling the from 100 years ago, invaded the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately, the Helldiver Corps was remobilized at such a scale not seen since the last days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. The war has been going on for 8 months now, with no end in sight. The Automatons have invaded &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, the Terminid Control System has failed, and a &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; has been created and destroyed. A mysterious spore cloud called &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; engulfs system after system, emitting from Terminid territory and getting closer to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The Automaton are now only one sector away from the home of Managed Democracy.\nThen, an event previously thought impossible would heighten the stakes of the Second Galactic War like nothing did before. In the midst of another Terminid offensive, the ongoing major order would be immediately aborted, as all Helldivers were immediately ordered into LIBCON 1 as a distress signal came from &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;. The unthinkable had just ocurred... The , thought extinct ever since their banishing after the First Galactic War, had returned and, worst of all, had begun abducting citizens and stripping them off their freedom, turning them into hordes of &lt;a href=\"Voteless\"&gt;Voteless&lt;/a&gt; zombies that ran rampant across Calypso's urban colonies.\nDecember 12th, 2184, would be a date that would go down in infamy, as every Helldiver in the Corps would immediately deploy onto Calypso to face this returning foe once again. After 3 days of battle, the Helldivers managed to repel the Illuminate at Calypso but, instead of surrendering, the squids continued to assault Super Earth colonies.\nChronologically uncertain events.\nOutbreak of the Carcino-Plague.\nWith the addition of the \"Chemical Agents\" warbond, a new event is mentioned in the descriptions of the \"Patient Zero's Remembrance\" and \"Standard of Safe Distance\" capes, which is the \"Outbreak of the Carcino-Plague\". It is unknown when this outbreak took place, with the only thing certain being that it must have occurred prior to the Second Galactic War, as no such illness is mentioned by any of the NPCs, nor has it been brought up in any major order at all.\nAt some point, the outbreak became bad enough to warrant the interment of those infected into quarantine zones, from which the SEAF would then recruit certain members for a new army division dubbed \"Division Zero\", a division specialized in biological warfare by having its soldiers spread their illness on the battlefield.\nJudging by how this illness is described, it is (or maybe was) a highly contagious disease, as its carriers are described to have been conscripted into the SEAF for the express purpose of spreading it. However, given that people infected with said disease were conscripted, it is possible, however unlikely, that the disease itself wasn't virulent enough to kill or seriously incapacitate its host (at least, not human hosts).\nGiven by how this disease is not mentioned anywhere else in either Helldivers 1 or Helldivers 2, it is possible that this outbreak occured during the 100 years between both games. It is also possible that the Carcino-Plague was eradicated during said time period.\nGovernment and Politics.\nSuper Earth is the galaxy's oldest known &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state\"&gt;unitary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state\"&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt; state, governed by the core values of prosperity, liberty, and democracy. All of its political institutions are headquartered in Prosperity City. Super Earth's government is composed of many administrative-level branches of government. \nCitizens of the Federation of Super Earth use automated voting software; they answer a few questions on the Galactic Wide Web (GWW) and the computer votes for them based on their answers. The GWW is a network of interlinked communication devices that transmits data using quantum communication, \"very elementary stuff\" according to the ship's C.O.\nNational Government.\nBranches of Government.\nThrough the many hints delivered throughout both games, it is safe to assume that Super Earth has some sort of separation of powers, as it is stated to have a \"President\" and \"Senators\" such as John W. Killjoy, and \"House Representatives\" such as Powley Colle. A \"Democratic Council\" is also mentioned in Helldivers 2 in one of the Broadcast Announcements and in one of the official lore videos, which most likely serves as a possible judiciary organ, thus establishing a possible Judicial branch.\nExecutive Branch.\nPresident.\nThe President of Super Earth serves as either the head of state or the head of government of the Federation, if not both. This information is not made clear in either of the games. Another piece of information that is unclear is the hierarchy of the government of Super Earth. The only executive role mentioned besides that of the President of Super Earth is that of the respective Colonial Overseers that can be found across the various planets one visits.\nSo far, the only president of Super Earth that is known to have canonically existed is Hannah S.C, the former president of Super Earth whose name can be found in commemorative plaques etched onto certain monuments that can be found in urban colonies. Who the current president of Super Earth is isn't know.\nColonial Overseer.\nColonial Overseers are the people responsible for making sure that planetary colonies remain stable, loyal, and productive. It is explained through in-game ads and posters that each Colonial Overseer is elected through suffrage, and that the Colonial Overseers often receive instructions from the SEAF to remain on their respective planets to help with their defense. This can be inferred by the SEAF Communication Devices that are found across the many planets in Helldivers 2.\nMinistries.\n\"The following is an excerpt from a bigger article, which can be found &lt;a href=\"Ministries%20and%20Megacorporations\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\"\nEach ministry dedicates itself to the continued sovereignty and progress of Super Earth in their own unique ways. It is never explained how these ministries came about or who their respective ministers are and how they are chosen. The most likely explanation is that the President/Democratic Council is responsible for selecting them.\nThe ministries of Super Earth are listed in order below: \nLegislative Branch.\nThe Legislative Branch of Super Earth is composed of two main bodies. The Super Earth House of Representatives and the Super Earth Senate. It is unknown if these two exist independently or exist as two parts of a collective Congress, as is the case in many real life countries that follow a system of separation of powers.\nSuper Earth House of Representatives.\nA very small glimpse of this portion of the government is shown in Helldivers 1 through House Representative Powley Colle, a character mentioned briefly whenever a new war is declared against the . This character's title of \"House Representative\" inherently implies the existence of a House of Representatives. It can be assumed that the Super Earth House of Representatives is where legislation is drafted and debated before being sent to the Senate in order for said legislation to then be sent to the President and be signed into law.\nWhile Helldivers 1 only gives the very brief spotlight to Powley Colle, it is very possible that there are multiple House Representatives.\nSuper Earth Senate.\nA small bit of information that is shown in Helldivers 1 about this portion of the government is through Senator John W. Killjoy, as his title of \"Senator\" directly implies the presence of a Super Earth Senate.\nIt is safe to assume that the Super Earth Senate is in charge of reviewing laws passed by the Super Earth House of Representatives so that the President can sign them into law, assuming that Super Earth's government operates in the same way that a real life federal government of this style would.\nWhile Helldivers 1 only introduces John W. Killjoy as Senator, it is very possible that there are many more senators.\nJudicial Branch.\nThe Democratic Council.\nFollowing the release of an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtOWwJXwxqIA\"&gt;official lore video for Liberty Day&lt;/a&gt; on October 23rd, 2024, it was confirmed that the Democratic Council is the organization responsible for publishing and presumably interpreting the text that composes the ideals of \"Managed Democracy\". The Democratic Council is stated to have presented the \"first and final draft\" of Managed Democracy, meaning that Managed Democracy serves as both the ideals of Super Earth and the basic law by which all other legislation must abide by in the Federation. This also establishes the Democratic Council as the judiciary in charge of settling legal disputes with the gentle touch of an iron fist.\nPolitical Climate.\nIt is made clear at several points in Helldivers 1 and in some of its descriptions that the government of Super Earth has a history of brutally suppressing dissidents. \nThe above means it is likely that (a portion of) early Super Earth riot police were fully-trained military assassins and reconnaissance specialists \"before\" Super Earth unified -- \"and\" that the Ministry of Defence also either acted as or supplemented a police force.\n\"Fun fact: the was \"developed by Dr. Junko under the 2079 act of self-defence research and has been tested extensively on live targets\". The DLC description for the also notes the following: \"Sometimes shunned by fellow Helldivers for their use of inhumane warfare, many a Helldiver is happy to have them on the mission when it comes down to life or death. It's not like the enemy is Human after all.\"\"\nForeign Relations and Diplomacy.\nHelldivers 1 consists of an endless series of wars against three factions: the , and The . As soon as one war is won (or lost), another one immediately starts. The admiral on the ship's bridge pretty much admits to this, stating: \"[...] of course, when we have won this war, there will be another to fight, and after that - another! After that? Another! I could go on, but you get my point - let us focus on this war.\"\n/&lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuper Earth's usual \"case for war\" against the Cyborg Nation is that a cybernetically augmented human, in an act of terrorism, detonated explosives in the centre of District 48 of Super Earth, killing 8 citizens. Those who doubt the official story run the risk of being labelled \"cyborg sympathizers\". One should note that although the initial explosion may have killed thousands, every war with the Cyborgs in the game's is caused by a much, much smaller-scale terrorist attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, the Cyborg Nation's homeworld, is a barren on the galactic fringe. Whenever it is conquered by Super Earth, the Cyborgs are then \"democratized\" by force, coerced into the voting booths by threat of losing their civil rights. Super Earth's Army Tactical Command invariably stations troops on the planet for a period of five years to \"keep the peace and \"run government positions\"\", after which the Cyborgs' culture is supposed to have transitioned to a \"fully democratic\" one (by Super Earth standards). Meanwhile, the Super Earth Construction Company (SECC), a government contractor, takes over the massive forges and industrial complexes of Cyberstan. Eventually, inevitably, another bombing begins this whole cycle anew.\nCyborgs are often depicted by the Super Earth government as socialists, and they're not helping their case with their choice of logo: a red star. Constantly shouting battle cries and muttering to themselves in a variety of languages, Cyborg troops gleefully deride the Helldivers and Super Earth as, among other things, \"plutarch scum\".\nRumours about the Cyborgs circulate among the ship's crew members; some (or all) of these rumours could be the result of Super Earth propaganda. According to one of the Privates, \"a crazy scientist started replacing body parts on people she had kidnapped.\" The threat of being taken away by Cyborgs for these \"perverse modifications\" is apparently used as a boogeyman.\nIn Helldivers 2, Super Earth's posture towards the , the successors of the , is a very stark escalation, as Super Earth rightfully treats them as an existential threat to their way of life, while the Cyborgs were at least given the chance to reintegrate into society. As such, Super Earth refuses to recognize the Automaton Legion's claims in the Milky Way, instead referring to it as an \"illegal occupation\". This position infers that, while Super Earth very much does not like the Automatons, they still recognize them as a separate country.\nThe are a sentient extraterrestrial species, their form reminiscent of very large Earth insects, arachnids, or crustaceans. As far as the scientists of Super Earth know, their homeworld is &lt;a href=\"Kepler%20Prime\"&gt;Kepler Prime&lt;/a&gt;, a on the eastern fringe of the galaxy.\nBugs are known to generate \"vast quantities\" of oil during decomposition, similar to how Earth's pre-human lifeforms provide us with fossil fuel sources. During the announcement of each new war against the Bugs, mention is made of \"lost oil pumps\" that the Helldiver Corps is to reactivate. These oil pumps (which, as shown in the game's intro, prominently feature a Helldiver skull emblem over an oil drop) are also found on &lt;a href=\"Kepler%20Prime\"&gt;Kepler Prime&lt;/a&gt;. The implications of this are that the Helldiver Corps is responsible for at least part of the resource-gathering process, and that they have been to &lt;a href=\"Kepler%20Prime\"&gt;Kepler Prime&lt;/a&gt; before \u2013 possibly triggering the Bugs to attack Super Earth.\nSuper Earth propaganda depicts the Bugs as a threat that will infest the entire galaxy if not suppressed. However, when the war against the Bugs is won, the tune is quickly changed; suddenly, the Bugs are a rare and valuable species that is a potentially unlimited supply of fossil fuel resources for Super Earth, and eliminating them \"just wouldn't be right from a moral perspective\". Following this, a certain scientist called Dr. Henk Ploeg then works on a way to safely breed the Bugs in a controlled manner. Since there is always a new war after the current one, and a new one after that, and so on, it can be inferred that this \"safe breeding\" of Bugs tends not to work out very well.\nBy the time of Helldivers 2, the , being more evolved forms of the Bugs from the prior century, are still treated the same as the Bugs that came before them, treated as a scourge to be cleansed until it is beneficial for Super Earth to contain, herd, and breed them again for E-710 harvesting.\nThe , or Sq'uith as they call themselves, are an advanced extragalactic race which, for millennia, has had settlements in the south quadrant of the galaxy. If Super Earth propaganda is to be believed, the aliens consider themselves enlightened beings (hence the name \u2013 but why would they call themselves the Sq'uith then?). Originating from the ocean, The Illuminate species makes use of bio-electronics and nano-powered devices. According to the ship's science officer, they still sting slightly when touched because of their vestigial electrolyte glands: \"The Illuminate went down the path of electricity in the same way we did from rocks to bullets\".\nThe blue-skinned species was first encountered in the late 21st century, when Illuminate recon craft were frequently sighted. These sightings were dismissed as folklore back then, but after a time, the Illuminate came forward with a peace offering. This was declined by the government of Super Earth when it was found out that the mollusk-like aliens had \"large quantities of world-destroying devices\", nicknamed \"obliterator bombs\" by Super Earth. This was deemed sufficient cause for a preemptive strike aimed at removing their presence from the galaxy and obtaining their highly-advanced technology. To quote Senator John W. Killjoy: \"The statement sends a clear message to all would-be threats to Super Earth; if they have more advanced technology than us, be prepared to pay the price\".\nAfter successfully defending against a region capital assault from the Illuminate, the ship's admiral reminds the player that there is solid evidence that the Illuminate were planning to use a planet-destroying device. However, lost region capitals can be recaptured from the Illuminate. Considering that Super Earth is \"destroyed\" and then moved to a new planet whenever the war is lost, the capitals could indeed have been destroyed and a new one with the same name set up; it could also simply mean that the Illuminate are not as willing to use their weapons of planetary destruction as the citizens of Super Earth are led to believe.\nSuper Earth deals with those who take a more tolerant stance towards the Sq'uith (describing the aliens as \"ancient and wise\") by means of public executions. The Helldivers are sent in to disarm or preferably capture any WMDs and other potentially useful technologies that eclipse what Super Earth has at its disposal.\nUpon their defeat, Super Earth forces the Illuminate to sign a treaty which disallows them from creating an armed forces branch and requires them to turn over all of their weapons technology to Super Earth. According to Dr. Henk Ploeg, PhD, \"the amount of technology we are going to receive will accelerate our technology tenfold and allow us to create \"peacekeeping devices\" that have the power to destroy entire planets!\"\nHowever, it would seem as though the weren't content with being extinct as, 100 years after being banished, they would seemingly return with a thirst of vengeance. In the months leading up to December, they would begin abducting several super earth citizens off of frontier planets, in order to turn them into the Voteless, hordes of possessed zombies under the control of the Illuminate. Then, on December 12th, 2184, at 22:42 SEST - EST, the Illuminate unleashed an invasion fleet onto the urbanized colonies of the planet &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, effectively forcing their entry into the Second Galactic War.\nMilitary.\nThe military of super earth is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Super Earth Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;\", collectively referred to as S.E.A.F. They are the defenders of Super Earth and her colonies. Split into several branches, the S.E.A.F. work tirelessly across the galaxy to uphold liberty, prosperity, justice, and assure every star system knows the sweet liberation of Managed Democracy. The Super Earth Armed Forces are commanded by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;, who provide them the critical information and funds required to protect and serve across the galaxy.\nSEAF HIGH COMMAND.\nThe S.E.A.F. High Command, sometimes referred to as \"Super Earth High Command\", stands as the tip of the spear for all Super Earth Armed Forces. Working in conjunction with the various ministries within the government, primarily the Ministry of Defence, High Command's purpose is to direct the Super Earth Armed Forces to assure they meet the demands of Super Earth across the galaxy. During times of war, High Command distributes &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;Major Orders&lt;/a&gt; to all forces within the S.E.A.F. The Helldivers particularly are given the most critical orders and are demanded to accomplish these tasks, no matter the odds.\nBranches of the S.E.A.F.\n\"The following section is an excerpt from a bigger article, which you can find &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe S.E.A.F. is divided into several branches and special forces organizations, each required to help successfully bring defend Super Earth and spread Managed Democracy. \nAdditional, Unspecified Roles.\nSomewhere alongside the S.E.A.F. hierarchy are certain specific roles that cannot be precisely attached to the military apparatus due to certain technicalities. These roles are the following: \nEconomy.\nIt is made very clear that Super Earth sees itself as a capitalist society, given how their enemies, the and the among them, align themselves with socialist ideology. However, in reality, it is also likely that Super Earth uses a planned economy model, given how the Ministry of Humanity controls the food supply and the Ministry of Prosperity takes care of distributing luxuries such as soda. While there are private enterprises and businesses, such as the Super Earth Construction Company, the Morguson Company, Permacura, Strohman News, and others, it is possible that these are state-operated businessses.\nE-710 Extraction.\nOne of the main means through which the Federation of Super Earth sustains its way of life is through the extraction of E-710. This activity takes place inside specialized E-710 farms that are constructed on planets with previously existing Terminid populations.\nIn these farms, Terminids are carefully herded, bred, experimented with and harvested due to the fact that they produce large amounts of E-710 after dying. E-710, being stated to be a vastly more efficient fuel source than anything else found in the galaxy so far, serves as the literal and metaphorical gasoline driving the Federation.\nE-710 itself is can be considered to be petroleum. It primarily exists in liquid form, as most of the facilities where it can be found consist of valves, pipes and liquid storage tanks. Its extraction and transportation also relies on hoses, pumps, and transport aircraft equipped with said items.\nMilitary Manufacturing.\nAnother means through which Super Earth drives its economy is through the manufacturing of weapons, both for civilian and military markets. This is best displayed through one of the TV Ads for the Morguson Company, which promotes hunting products like the &lt;a href=\"SG-225%20Breaker\"&gt;SG-12 Breaker Assault Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, Super Earth produces vast amounts of &lt;a href=\"Armory%20%28Helldivers%202%29\"&gt;armours&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;munitions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are meant to sustain the war effort against the enemies of Freedom.\nAgriculture and Fishing.\nAnother industry in Super Earth that can be seen heavily in Helldivers 2 is the agricultural market, as players will often come across abandoned farms in pretty much every planet they visit. While some are obviously meant to serve as subsistence farming for individual colonists, players will sometimes find large, fully grown fields of crops during certain missions, indicating that some colonies can perform some level of commercial farming.\nAnother aspect of this market is shown through several soda vending machines that can be found scattered across the galaxy. \"Brewed Freedom\" and \"Taste of Democracy\" are among the most common soft drinks sold, with \"Taste of Democracy\" being voted the \"#1 Soft Drink in the Galaxy\". \"Democracy Drafts Premium\" Light Beer packs can also be found laying around in some objectives, indicating the presence of a brewing industry.\nOne company that is given a special spotlight is the C.O.B. Corporation, which manages some of the radar station terminals that players can occasionally find in missions. Their logo can be seen in many abandoned boxes and appliances that can be found left behind on the planets that the players visit. \nJudging by how its logo resembles a corn cob, the C.O.B. Corporation must be a big part of the food industry, while its additional DNA-double helix imagery suggests it may also dabble in genetically-modified organics, if not genetics entirely, most likely as part of the ever-growing colonization efforts of the Ministry of Expansion.\nIn one of the voice lines by the Service Technician, it is mentioned that \"fish and chips\" can occasionally be served at the chow hall of the Super Destroyer during certain \"fish fry nights\". In another voiceline, the Service Technician mentions how the Super Destroyer receives a \"shipment of Purples\", while also pointing out their personal dislike of such fruits. These 2 voicelines hint at the possibility of certain planets being able to fish at a commercially viable scale, as well as also being able to farm fruits and grow orchards successful enough to allow for interplanetary commerce. These voicelines both hint at different Super Earth planets producing different types of export goods, with some planets exporting fish and others exporting fruits.\nAdditionally, those that pre-ordered &lt;a href=\"Helldivers%202\"&gt;Helldivers 2&lt;/a&gt; were given access to the TR-7 Ambassador of the Brand armor, which is explicitly stated to be made as a \"promotional armor for SUMY Corp, as part of a highly successful marketing campaign for frozen yogurt\"\nMining.\nA very prominent industry in Helldivers 1 and 2 is the mining industry. Not only is Cyberstan explicitly stated to be a mining colony in Helldivers 1, but it is also shown in Helldivers 2 that many planets often conduct mining operations at scales big enough to require forklifts and freight containers.\nWith the issuing of &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Operations%23Operation_Freedom%27s_Forge\"&gt;Operation Freedom's Forge&lt;/a&gt;, it has been revealed that Super Earth is capable of building and operating mining complexes at the mantle level of a planet, which allows it to build massive \"Deep Mantle Forge\" complexes intended for massive metalworking projects, such as those required for the creation of the Democracy Space Station.\nConstruction and Terraforming.\nOne industry that is given a special mention is the construction industry. As mentioned before, whenever Super Earth defeats the in , they allow the Super Earth Construction Company to take control of the planet's forges and industrial facilities.\nWith the introduction of Urban Colonies in the Omens of Tyranny update, it was also revealed that Super Earth has a specialized individual, the M.C.S.E (Monument's Commissioner of Super Earth), in order to commission the construction of commemorative plaques and possibly other monuments.\nAdditionally, it is hinted that Super Earth has terraforming technology, at least capable of terraforming lunar bodies.\nService Industry.\nWith the introduction of Urban Colonies in the &lt;a href=\"Omens%20of%20Tyranny\"&gt;Omens of Tyranny&lt;/a&gt; update, some of the new buildings that can be found feature signs indicative of them being private businesses, as they read \"Opening Hours: 1pm-2pm\", which could indicate that these building house more office-like businesses such as consultancy firms. These buildings, alongside some other buildings that more closely resemble office blocs and the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Ministries%20and%20Megacorporations\"&gt;Trustor&lt;/a&gt; corporation in the game suggest the existence of a robust service industry across the Federation.\nPharmaceutical.\nAnother industry that is given a small but special spotlight is the pharmaceutical industry, as it is explicitly stated that the Stims used by the Helldivers come from a company called \"Permacura\". Permacura manages the production and distribution of the Stims that Helldivers use, though judging by the training manual tips' quote, it would appear Permacura also serves a role in civilian society, given how this last disclaimer added very much seems to exist for the purposes of marketing.\nAdditionally, certain products such as the \"Eagle Sweat\" deodorant sold by Trustor are stated to \"literally rewrite your DNA to make you smell like a Hero of the Federation\", as per their own advertising that can sometimes be seen in the ship's broadcasting screen above the Acquisition Center.\nTechnology.\nTransporation and Electricity.\nA highlight of Super Earth's economy is its technology. After the First Galactic War, Super Earth gained the ability to build starships which are capable of faster-than-light travel, which served as the primary driving force of the 100 years of explosive expansion and exploration before the Second Galactic War. Additionally, Super Earth boasts a number of impressive technologies such as the Galactic Wide Web, interplanetary battle stations, terraforming technology, and many others.\nFrom what can be seen in the introductory cinematic of Helldivers 2, the people of Super Earth mostly make use of clean energy, as every house seen has an array of solar panels on the roof. Additionally, some buildings on other planets can be found which utilize wind turbines, as well as other buildings which have solar farms next to them. \nSomething that is also made visible in both Helldivers 1 and 2, although it is missing in the gameplay for the latter, is that Super Earth still uses automobiles. The ones used in 2184 are most likely electric, given how these do not show any emissions in the introductory cinematic, as well as all the prop cars that can be seen in the urban colonies that were introduced with the return of the Illuminate. \nBesides the introduction cinematic, players in Helldivers 1 can call in an assortment of various vehicles, ranging from tanks to motorcycles. Meanwhile, in Helldivers 2, players can call in two varieties of combat &lt;a href=\"EXO-45%20Patriot%20Exosuit\"&gt;exosuits&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"walkers\". Super Earth also makes regular usage of space-capable aircraft, with the most salient examples being the Eagle fighter and the Pelican transport ship. As well, players can also make use of the &lt;a href=\"M-102%20Fast%20Recon%20Vehicle\"&gt;Fast Recon Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, though this vehicle still makes use of liquid combustible fuel, possibly E-710. \nBesides the usable vehicles, Helldivers will often encounter a multitude of different civilian cars whenever they fight in planets with urban settlements. These cars range from pickup trucks, to lorries to 4-door sedans that are all very curvy in their shape but that are otherwise similar to the cars used in our modern day society. One thing worthy of note is that these cars do not feature any visible exhaust pipes or gasoline ports, which may be a product of optimization although it could also be indicative of them being a new type of electric car. This implication would also indicate that E-710 is somehow more efficient than electric vehicles, as the Fast Recon Vehicle runs on a limited amount of liquid fuel.\nWhile not explicitly shown, it is made clear that Super Earth is accustomed to utilizing nuclear energy for transportation, as certain armors are reported to have plutonium batteries. \nTime Standard.\nSuper Earth's official time is \"Super Earth Standard Time\", remaining almost uniform across all planets under its control. One can notice this by looking attentively at the clock overlayed over any planet that the Helldiver may feel like diving into. Daylight Savings Time is called \"Freedom Savings Time\". Clocks are set back one hour to compensate, even on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;super destroyers&lt;/a&gt;. By 2184, this is still preserved, as the Service Technician sometimes remarks how setting the clocks on the Super Destroyer back gives them extra time to maintain their tools. However, this is in stark contrast to the lack of a day-night cycle aboard Super Destroyers.\nGalactic Wide Web.\nThe Galactic Wide Web, sometimes shortened to the GWW, is the Federation's evolution of the ancient World Wide Web from the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Utilizing a complicated network of quantum computers and interlinked particles, this network can transfer all types of information, from sound to video to text, back and forth between Super Earth and any other point in the galaxy, be it to Super Destroyers, Intergalactic Battle Stations, distant planetary colonies, any vessels performing FTL jumps, and even spaceships performing deep space exploration.\nGiven its nature, the GWW surprisingly has little to no lag. However, some lag is added in because of the constant surveillance performed by the Democratic Investigation Agency and others, due to the necessity of the Ministry of Truth to effectively expunge any and all alien sympathizers,\nThere are many ways to access the Galactic Wide Web, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;on-the-ground&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;terminals&lt;/a&gt; to portable communication devices that players can often find at minor points of interest, such as SEAF Communication Devices.\nCitizenship Classification Structure.\nThe Citizenship Classification Structure, known for its acronym \"CCS\", is a nation-wide &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System\"&gt;social credit rating system&lt;/a&gt;. The CCS, judging by the lines of dialogue by the Service Technician, works through a system of tiers going downwards from Class A to Class C. The higher the citizenship class, the better the quality of available services becomes and the greater the opportunities become for things like housing and education. Something that is hinted at by the Service Technician is that military service can serve as a pathway to upgrading one's citizenship class.\nAdditionally, this system seems to support its own currency of \"Citizenship Points\", which citizens can use to purchase certain benefits, such as improved healthcare, access to a pet license, and other commodities. Citizenship Points can be earned through various means, with one of the known ones being to simply just report any suspicious behaviour or conversations in one's workplace, possibly even extending into reporting illegal activities or rhetoric happening within one's own family, groups of friends, or even one's own community.\nGiven its nature, it is possible that this system is managed by the Ministry of Humanity, in conjunction with the Ministry of Unity, with the infrastructure being run through the Galactic Wide Web in order to allow monitoring by the Ministry of Truth. In this way, the hands of liberty are intertwined.\nCulture &amp; Society.\nSuper Earth boasts a culture of extreme patriotism, to an extent that some (mostly its enemies and their sympathizers) would call \"fanatical\". Its citizens always display utmost devotion and loyalty to Super Earth and the ideals of Freedom and Managed Democracy, going so far as to denounce their own children, parents, relatives, neighbors, and close friends if they ever discover them committing treasonous acts or failing to perform certain signs of loyalty. Loyalty to the government of Super Earth is not only something that every citizen of Super Earth actively partakes in, but is also heavily incentivized by the government, as Democracy Officers will often reward those that report any signs of disloyalty.\nIt is often said through TV ads that all citizens are equal on Super Earth, meaning that there is no such thing as intolerance or discrimination of any kind towards anyone that is not an enemy of Humanity or a dissident that has abandoned the ideals of Super Earth. However, one aspect is made very clear: everyone is equal. But the Helldivers are the most equal of all.\nThe minimum legal age at which any citizen of the federation can work is at seven years of human age. From hereon out, citizens can freely volunteer into any field of the industry, from weapons manufacturing to mining and farming. Citizens over the 16 years of age can enlist into the Super Earth Armed Forces.\nSuper Earth is a highly militaristic society. All children are given a bolt-action rifle (which is also used by the Super Earth Armed Forces as a ceremonial rifle) when they turn 16 to encourage military service, and SEAF personnel are always well treated, if not revered, in civil society. It is possible that the government often supplies the M2016 Constitution to its citizens for free, if not other weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Points%20of%20Interest\"&gt;Break Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, a double barrel shotgun that is only able to be found at Minor Points of Interest in Helldivers 2. By 2184, the M2016 Constitution has been replaced by the R-2124 Constitution, a modernized version of the M2016. \nCapeless Helldivers patrol the streets with &lt;a href=\"AR-23%20Liberator\"&gt;AR-23 Liberators&lt;/a&gt; in hand in order to preserve peace and order. \nHelldivers are considered celebrities in civil society, as the Service Technician will often remark their disbelief (and that of their civilian loved ones/relatives/etc.) at getting to work so close to Helldivers, having Helldiver posters in their bedroom as a kid and with many promotional ads showing children wearing Helldiver helmets and costumes.\nEvery morning, all citizens must swear a Pledge of Allegiance to Super Earth. Crews assigned to Super Destroyers, colonies, or otherwise found away from the safe embrace of Super Earth must orient themselves towards the exact position of Super Earth. The Service Technician will remark that they always feel like they can tell where Super Earth is, meaning that getting Super Earth's location in relation to one-self is imperative when taking the Pledge.\nAdditionally, both the &lt;a href=\"Service%20Technician\"&gt;Service Technician&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20Master\"&gt;Ship Master&lt;/a&gt; admit to never having been to Super Earth themselves, implying that many of the Federation's citizens are born on planetary colonies.\nThe Illuminate, and the Cyborgs before them, are used as the boogeymen in cautionary tales for kids, according to voicelines by both the Ship Master and the Service Technician. However, in both cases, it can be noticed that this only occurs with factions that Super Earth believes to have decisively and indisputably defeated, which explains why both the Service Technician and the Ship Master explain how much disbelief they have regarding the return of the Illuminate.\nDemographics.\nMost, if not all of the citizens of Super Earth are humans, obviously. However, a small portion of the population has taken on adapting cybernetic augmentations onto their bodies (often, illegally). These people are the , and whenever they aren't trying to secede, they are acknowledged to be a minority within Super Earth society. \nThey are often persecuted, mostly due to the terrorist bombings that some of their members engage in and the socialist ideology adopted by the Cyborg Separatists. Certain Helldivers, referred to as the \"Steeled Veterans\", have mechanical augmentations, with some of their limbs replaced with prosthetics. However, this is implied to be due to the fact that they have lost their limbs in combat, and not by choice, like the Cyborgs.\nThe Federation is also inhabited by a vast quantity of . Obviously, they are not considered to be citizens due to their fascistic nature, and as a result are safely contained in E-710 farms where they are able to be safely and productively harvested. Terminids, when not being farmed, are also a popular tourist attraction for the human citizens of Super Earth, as seen by the famous Tyranny Park on &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nSuper Earth's educational system seems to be much more advanced by the late 21st and early 22nd centuries than it was in the days prior to the Great War. Many subjects, such as quantum computation and space travel, are considered \"elementary stuff\" by the Ship's C.O in Helldivers 1.\nC-01 Perm.\nThe C-01 PERM (pronounced \"cee-one-perm\") child permit form is required for citizens of Super Earth to legally reproduce. According to the NPC Privates on the ship's bridge, these forms are not easy to fill out. Interestingly, the female Private also mentions having a wife (in text, but not in the spoken dialogue). If this is not an oversight (considering that the Privates mostly have the same lines), it can be inferred that same-sex relationships are not considered a taboo in Super Earth culture. Procreation applications typically require a 180-day review process.\nAccording to one of the loading tips in Helldivers 2, one must fill out a C-01 Perm before \"any act that could result in a child\", implying that the C-01 permit is also meant as a permit for sexual intercourse. Judging by the amount of cryogenically frozen Helldivers that are allocated per Super Destroyer (24 Reinforcements maximum with the &lt;a href=\"Boosters\"&gt;Increased Reinforcement Budget&lt;/a&gt; booster, but more can be procured if the allotted 24 reinfocements are spent up to a theoretical maximum of 44 helldivers per mission) and the many rockets carrying frozen Helldivers that can be seen at the end of the tutorial, it is safe to assume that the C-01 Permit is the single most submitted form in the galaxy.\nFestivities and Holidays.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Day\"&gt;Liberty Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nA key festivity that is often mentioned in both Helldivers and Helldivers 2 is Liberty Day. Liberty Day is celebrated by the citizens of Super Earth every year on the 26th of October. In real life, The \"HELLDIVERS\" community also celebrates Liberty Day, and Arrowhead Studios has released free DLC, available to everyone, on this date consistently (as of 2018).\nIn-universe, citizens light scarecrows called \"Liberty Pires\", which are shaped after Super Earth's enemies and place presents beneath them for children. \nLiberty Day commemorates the anniversary for the publication of the first and final draft of \"Managed Democracy\" ever written by the Democratic Council.\nLiberty Day is also when Class B Citizens are given an hour off of work so that they can watch the Liberty Parades. Strohman Media holds a 24-hour livestream from the Wall of Martyrs. Famous Helldivers give interviews, and civilians have a chance to meet them. Dissidents are executed for the public's enjoyment.\nFestival of Reckoning.\nOn December 2024, Helldivers 2 introduced the Festival of Reckoning, which now is the official replacement for the ancient celebration of Christmas in the Federation. It is a 3-day festival during which the Helldivers are issued special thematic weaponry and stratagems according to each day's theme. The more kills that the Helldivers get, the higher the discounts that the citizens of Super Earth get.\nFor the December 2184 edition, the First Day of the Festival of Reckoning issued a fleetwide deployment of &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrages&lt;/a&gt;. As well, the &lt;a href=\"StA-X3%20W.A.S.P.%20Launcher\"&gt;StA-X3 W.A.S.P Launcher&lt;/a&gt; was also made available. Following that, the &lt;a href=\"FLAM-40%20Flamethrower\"&gt;FLAM-40 Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mines%23Incendiary%20Mines\"&gt;MD-14 Incendiary Mines&lt;/a&gt; were all issued, one after the other.\nOn the Second Day of the Festival of Reckoning, a holiday song would be sent through the Dispatch System. Lyrics are as follows:\n&lt;syntaxhighlight&gt;\nAll Helldivers are invited to join in the classic holiday carol \"Here They Come a'Reckonin':\"\nOh, here they come a'Recknonin',\nO'er hill and vale,\nChildren play, bombs away,\nSuper Earth we hail!\nHere they come a'Reckonin',\nJustice justly served,\nFlowers grow, blood will flow,\nPeace on Super Earth!\n&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;\nOther Holidays.\nOther festivities often mentioned throughout many TV ads are \"Martyr's Day\", most likely meant to commemorate those who have given their lives in service to freedom, and \"Voting Day\", which is a holiday to celebrate the idea of voting.\nA festivity often brought up by the Service Technician is All Heroes' Eve, which is possibly an adaptation of ancient Halloween, given how the Service Technician details how \"the adults would all dress up as \". Another festivity brought up by the Service Technician is Heroes' Day. \nAfter the final liberation of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, the President of Super Earth officially recognized April 3rd, the first full day of peace on the planet, as Malevelon Creek Memorial Day. Every year on this day, Super Earth citizens will unite for a full 3 minutes of their lunch break in solemn remembrance of those who gave their lives to free Malevelon Creek. \nIn addition, all Helldivers were issued a special commemorative cape, so they may carry the memory of their fallen companions into battle.\nArchitecture.\nSuper Earth's architecture, judging by the urban colonies found at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; and other planets following the resurgence of the Illuminate, mostly consists of neo-modernist buildings with round-cornered square buildings. Colonies are built car-centric and streets are at least 4 lanes wide, with 2 lanes in each direction. These colonies all have functioning power grids and water management systems, as working fire hydrants, sewage channels, transmission towers, functioning street lights and vending machines can be found. As well, lots of parkland with decorative trees and bushes can be found, most of which heavily feature flags and Helldiver statues in all their splendor.\nIn urban colonies, most buildings are 2 or more stories tall at their lowest and 5 stories at their highest, however, there are many shifts in elevation which require public stairs to be constructed. Additionally, SEAF defensive structures, such as the &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20SAM%20Site\"&gt;SAM Site&lt;/a&gt; or spaceports that can sometimes be used for evacuation, are embedded into the colonies' infrastructure, most likely for protection against incoming invaders and ease of use, while things such as the SEAF Artillery battery are kept on the outskirts, though they will still be embedded between buildings if there is no more space.\nA feature common throughout every urban colony, regardless of biome, are the flat green grass lawns that can be found on parks and in private home lawns. While these are most likely artificial, they are a notable fixture of Super Earth lifestyle.\nBuildings are built relatively close together, although there still are many buildings with alleyways in between. Urban colonies are surrounded by a protective wall, possibly to deter alien wildlife from attacking their citizens. It is worth noting that planet colonies feature a heavy absence of public transportation vehicles or infrastructure, such as buses, metro stations or even taxi cabs; indicating that these colonies may not reach a population high enough to warrant the construction and maintenance of said services.\nHowever, in most other planets across the Federation, even some planets closer to Super Earth such as &lt;a href=\"Shallus\"&gt;Shallus&lt;/a&gt;, the colonies are mostly undeveloped, with scattered buildings, dwellings and complexes dotting the otherwise untouched wilderness.\nThe most prominent structures of the Federation has outside of the urban colonies are mainly those used for objectives, such as the spaceports used in most extraction sites, Emergency Evacuation missions, all the tilesets used for the Evacuate High Value Asset defense missions, certain tilesets of the objective site in Spread Democracy missions, all the variants for the Terminate Illegal Broadcast and Destroy Rogue Research Station objectives and some of the possible variants of the generator sub-objective.\nBesides those, most of the visible infrastructure Super Earth's colonies show is purely utilitarian, consisting mostly of oil rigs, storage silos, radio towers and military facilities such as the SEAF Artillery, the Radar Station and the SEAF SAM Site.\nHowever, despite their remoteness, the colonists of Super Earth still take care to proudly fly the flag of the Federation, as well as to erect tall stone statues of the Helldivers, some issued with commemorative metal plaques. Unfortunately, the enemies of Super Earth also make sure to desecrate and defile any Super Earth infrastructure they come across.\nSome unique structures that Super Earth is said to have but that aren't seen are those used for Major Order objectives, such as the Super Citizen Anne's Hospital for the Very Sick Children, which used to be located in Vernen Wells before it was destroyed by the Automatons during Operation Trolley Problem. While the hospital nor its ruins can be found in the planet, it is worth mentioning. Similarly, locations such as the Xenoentomology Center at Turing, the Deep Mantle Forge Complex at Claorell, the Terminid Research Preserve and Tyranny Park at Acamar IV or the AM Factory Hub at Achernar Secundus aren't able to be found in-game either.\nThe enemies of Super Earth will often defile symbols of Super Earth, mostly Helldiver Memorials. Automatons often place their red star banners around the Helldiver statues and further defile these monuments by digging mass graves before them. This is most noticeable in a certain variant of the \"Spread Democracy\" objective site, which preserves some abandoned houses and a Helldiver statue in the middle.\nThe Terminids simply dig their putrid nests inside of the abandoned dwellings, filling them with web-looking yellow strings and filth, which is specially noticeable in certain variants of the medium and heavy nests, as well as some variants of the Shrieker Nest, all of which feature piles of corpses and destroyed houses.\nThe Illuminate often pitch their decadent monoliths and nefarious altars on top of destroyed buildings and parks, which can be noticed very well during urban colony missions. As well, they often park their warp ships on top of public parks and leave mountains of civilian corpses at the base of their monoliths.\nSymbols of Super Earth.\nFlag of Super Earth.\n\"The following is an excerpt from a bigger article, which can be found &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Flag of Super Earth, affectionally named \"The White, Yellow, Blue\" by the majority of the population, is the official national banner of the Federation of Super Earth, symbolizing the union of all Humanity under Managed Democracy. It is proudly flown, hung, or otherwise displayed and plastered on every place where Freedom's presence can be felt. So far, between 2084 and 2184, there have been up to 3 versions shown throughout both and &lt;a href=\"Helldivers%202\"&gt;Helldivers 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoing by traditional vexillological analysis, it is possible to assume what each color may represent in the flag of Super Earth. The Blue in the flag would represent the vastness of space, with an azimuthal equidistant projection of Super Earth, centered on Prosperity City, being emblazoned right in the center to represent Super Earth's role as the galaxy's shinning beacon of Freedom.\nThe White in the flag would symbolize the pacifying nature of Managed Democracy, as well as humanity's unfaltering love for peace, as well as Super Earth's pacifying mission, reminding its citizens about why they fight and reminding their enemies of the futility of their struggle against humankind. Some versions of the flag include simplified wreaths guarding Super Earth, further hinting at this potential meaning.\nLastly, the yellow in the flag would stand for the Prosperity brought on by Managed Democracy, with the vast expanse of the Federation and the might of not just its armed forces but the product of the free, hard labor of all its citizens standing as tangible demonstrations of exactly how humanity will triumph and flourish over any adversary, be it natural or alien, with no cost being too high and no sacrifice too great.\nThere are a total of seven, evenly separated stars beneath Super Earth, laid in a horizontal line with size decreasing from the central star outwards. Each of the 7 stars possibly represents each of the 7 sectors of Super Earth, once more hinting towards the union of all mankind under one banner: The Banner of Liberty.\nAnthem of Super Earth.\nThe Anthem of Super Earth, officially named the \"Super Earth National Anthem\" is the official national anthem of the Federation of Super Earth. Its lyrics are made up of 11 verses, accentuated by one final proclamation.\nIn real life, the Super Earth National Anthem was composed by Wilbert Roget II, with the lyrics being written by Ross Tregenza, as part of the official soundtrack for &lt;a href=\"Helldivers%202\"&gt;Helldivers 2&lt;/a&gt;, which officially released on September 20th, 2024. The lyrics can be found below and a link to the anthem can be found at the top of this page in the information box, as well as in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4z77WIELtpA\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;\nLyrics.\nFREEDOM MUST REIGN OVER EVERY LAST STAR\nTHROUGH CITIZEN'S BLOOD SPILLED IN OUR RIGHTEOUS WARS.\nHONOR THEIR DEATHS, DO YOUR PART FOR THE CAUSE.\nSTEADFAST SUPPORT OF OUR REGIME\nIS HOW HUMANKIND WILL REIGN SUPREME.\nNO QUESTIONS OR DOUBTS SHALL BE ALLOWED\nTRAITORS WILL ALL BE DISAVOWED.\nMANAGED DEMOCRACY IS THE TRUE PATH\nALL WHO RESIST IT SHALL SUFFER OUR WRATH.\nWHITE, YELLOW, BLUE FLYING ON ALL THE WORLDS.\nJUSTICE AND HOPE ARE FOREVER UNFURLED.\nOUR WAY OF LIFE, GALAXY WIDE,\nPAVED WITH THE SKULLS OF THOSE WHO'VE DIED.\nUNSLAKEABLE TIDE, OF SUPER EARTH PRIDE,\nA TORRENT THAT CAN'T BE SATISFIED.\nWE SACRIFICE, FOR PARADISE,\nANYTHING LESS WILL NOT SUFFICE.\nCITIZENS RISE! LIBERTY RISE!\nSUPER EARTH RISE UP TO THE SKIES.\nSTAY FREE!\nSports.\nA sport mentioned in one of the TV ads is \"Freedomball\". Judging by the name, it is possibly a version of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt;, as the introduction cinematic shows a soccer ball in the front porch of the broadcast announcer's house before his family is slaughtered.\nAnother sport that is mentioned in the description of the CE-35 Trench Engineer armor is \"Fence-Smashing\", a local pastime in &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this activity is a sport or not, is unknown.\nMedia.\nSuper Earth allows for media such as film, videogames, and songs to be commonplace, as famous actors such as Chip Messiter and Jen Shriver are brought up in the descriptions of certain armors that are available in the Super Store, while some popular songs are mentioned in the TV Ads, such as \"Can't Ration My Love\" and \"Our Love is like Liberty (Indestructible)\". Musicals are also popular in Super Earth, such as \"Lost My Heart to a Man in a Helmet\" and \"Hazard Pay: The Musical\".\nLiterature in Helldivers is mostly comprised of novels and comic books, with the vast majority of them revolving around tales involving military units, such as the mystery novel \"Truth Enforcers: Enforcers of Truth\", the \"Tales of the Viper Commandos\" comic book series, the \"Call of the Frontier\" comic book series and the \"Amazing Democracy\" magazines.\nTV Shows are also a commonplace piece of media in Super Earth, with some examples being \"Jen Shriver : The Science Diver\"\nAs for videogames canon to the Helldivers universe, the only one known that has also made an appearance as a minigame is the \"Stratagem Hero\" an arcade minigame that is only available to those that buy the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Citizen%20Edition\"&gt;Super Citizen Edition&lt;/a&gt; in Helldivers 2.\nA plausible conclusion can be made that all media must be first approved by the Ministry of Truth. It seems that the Ministry of Truth allows criticisms of things such as supply rationing, war, and other themes, so long as the blame is placed upon the enemies of Super Earth, who are the real culprits, after all.\nReligion.\nJudging by the voicelines uttered by both the Helldivers and most NPCs, like the civilians in the rescue missions and the Democracy Officer, it is safe to assume that \"Liberty\", sometimes referred to as \"Lady Liberty\", is personified and venerated to an extent where people will often say \"Liberty-Forsaken\" instead of something like \"God-forsaken\" and \"Sweet Liberty!\" instead of something like \"Oh my god!\". \nHowever, in rare occasions, players and NPCs will also sometimes say \"flag-forsaken\" instead. Despite this, it can be safely assumed that Super Earth is a secular state, as these expressions never show up in any Major Order briefings, nor does the Ship Master use these expressions in any of their voicelines, implying that secularity is enforced throughout the military command chain.\nDemocracy Officers may engage in celibacy, as the Democracy Officer will admit to having no significant other if they speak with the Helldiver.

{"id": "3260", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3260", "title": "Fenrir III", "text": "Fenrir III is one of the four planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Its general landscape consists of subzero temperatures and open lands peppered with large craters.\nTopography.\nFenrir III's surface is dominated by grey, rocky plateaus. Though the moon is largely barren, sparse amounts of bush-like vegetation have been known to survive its frigid climate. Intermittent meteor storms have left Fenrir III pock-marked by craters. Citizens are advised to stay indoors to avoid such meteor impacts.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nFenrir III was, up until February 2184, a peaceful mining colony of Super Earth in the Fenrir System, its barren landscape standing just far away enough from its star to be habitable yet cold, as its colonists rotated between shifts at the mines and taking shelter from the occasional Meteor Storms that constantly befell this planet.\nHowever, among these Meteor Storms came one that would permanently scar this planet more than any other. On February 10th, 2184, Fenrir III would be overwhelmed by the landfall of several onto its surface, during one of the very first engagements between Super Earth and the alien insects.\nWith casualties mounting and Terminid numbers rising, the Colonial Overseer called upon the broader SEAF for reinforcements. Luckily for him, with the ongoing Terminid outbreak, Super Earth High Command had just issued an order for the reactivation of the mightiest force of them all: The Helldivers.\nOperation Valiant Enclosure.\nThe very first Helldiver Operation was to repel the advancing Terminid forces at Heeth and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, key chokepoint planets that are crucial to getting past the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Helldivers would demonstrate peak combat readiness and, while taking on the hordes at both planets successfully, they also managed to advance into Fenrir. By the 14th, the Helldivers had easily secured both of the objective planets but the fighting at Fenrir hadn't ceased, just as it hadn't ceased anywhere else.\nWith the appearance of the on the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would have to divert towards &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt;, as the newly appeared foe began to encroach upon more and more planets. Due to this untimely foe interfering with the Helldivers, Fenrir III would only be fully liberated by February 18th.\nOperation Veld Containment.\nHowever, Fenrir III would be unable to rebuild its defenses, as too many able-bodied citizens had been slain in the defense of their homes. Fittingly, once the Terminids made a second attempt against Fenrir on March 1st, it fell immediately, leading to its total capture before the Helldivers could even heed its call for aid. As such, amidst the operation to liberate &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt; from the nefarious bugs, Fenrir III would be liberated on March 2nd without much incident.\nBut the Terminids persisted and, before any defense could be mounted, attacked Fenrir III yet again and recaptured it, requiring a second subsequent liberation campaign that would come to an end on March 3rd. Yet, after 2 defeats, the odious insects continued further, attacking once more and taking over the planet, requiring a third liberation campaign that only came to an end on March 4th.\nBut even still, after 3 defeats, the Terminids persisted and, on March 4th, the Terminids attacked Fenrir III a fourth consecutive time, this time managing to hold onto the planet.\nInstallation of the Terminid Control System.\nWhile the Terminids desperately tried to latch onto Fenrir's barren surface, Super Earth's scientists had devised a solution for the odious fascist infestation. The TCS (Terminid Control System) was a network of towers capable of dispersing industrial amounts of the novel \"Termicide\", a neurotoxin engineered to exclusively kill Terminids while leaving all other lifeforms unharmed. As such, Super Earth High Command issued a major order to capture not just Fenrir III, but all of the Umlaut Sector in order to install the TCS towers on them, making the Umlaut Sector into a network of Barrier Planets that would prevent further Terminid Expansion.\nOn March 13th, Fenrir III would be liberated for a sixth consecutive time, allowing for the installation of the Terminid Control System and putting an end to the early Terminid outbreak, allowing Fenrir's colonists respite and relief as they were finally able to return to their sufficiently sized dwellings.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nFor the first time in 2 months, Fenrir III would enjoy prosperity and freedom like it had never done before. Safe from any further Terminid incursions, the population of the colony exploded and its economy boomed, as the Ministry of Expansion conducted several efforts into the nearby &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, installing new infrastructure and settling new planets as Fenrir III slowly began to serve more and more as a handy transport hub planet through which flowed an important portion of travel and resources that then went onto other sectors.\nAs the Automatons were finally purged from the Severin Sector on April 3rd, the people of Fenrir celebrated the righteous victory at Malevelon Creek while the President of Super Earth officially declared it the Malevelon Creek Memorial Day. However, fascism is an ever-present threat, its treachery seeping and growing in the tiniest of shadows.\nOn April 6th, the Automatons would return from deep space, invading &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and taking over the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Then, on April 29th, catastrophe ensued upon the Barrier Planets.\nThrough an unknown process known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis\"&gt;hormesis&lt;/a&gt;, a minuscule portion of the Terminids that still remained at Fenrir for farming purposes had developed immunity to the Termicide. These Terminids slowly began to breed more and more rapidly until, on April 29th, they surprinsingly overran all Barrier Planets at once, with Meridia's broods managing to reproduce at an alarmingly fast rate, up to 20 times faster than normal.\nMeridia would fall to the Terminids, only for the savage, base insectoids to make a show of their hatred, as they gruesomely terraformed the once beautiful Jungle planet into a horrid nest of putrefaction, a Terminid Supercolony.\nFearing that the rest of the Barrier Planets were soon to follow, the Helldivers were ordered to deactivate the Terminid Control System, hoping that this would prevent Fenrir III and the other barrier planets from meeting the same grizzly fate.\nFenrir III would be secured on May 1st, allowing its colonists to breathe a short sigh of relief as they realized what had just begun.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Outbreak.\nAided by the Terminid Supercolony, the bugs ran wild across the Eastern Galactic rim, invading more and more planets as they poured onto the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt; like the plague they are. Fenrir III would be attacked by Terminids on May 9th, its rebuilt defenses crumbling upon the tidal wave of insectoids pouncing at it. The Helldivers would manage to liberate Fenrir by May 11th, but its colonists wouldn't be able to really rebuild much, letting it fall to the Terminids again on May 16th, only for the Helldivers to dislodge the insects off the planet 8 hours later.\nThen, on May 19th, Fenrir III would be attacked again, but the Helldivers managed to repel the assault without much other incident.\nOperation Emancipator.\nHowever, Fenrir III was still in constant danger, as it stood next to the Supercolony. Amidst an operation to capture and repurpose an Automaton Petafactory on &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, Fenrir III and Angel's Venture were both attacked. On May 25th, the Helldivers had to leave Fenrir III to its own devices in order to appropriately ensure that the SEAF Training Facilities at Angel's Venture were properly secured, leading to Fenrir III's fall once more.\nHowever, shortly the operation concluded, Fenrir III would be quickly rescued by the Helldivers, leading to Fenrir III's liberation on May 27th, shortly after nearby Heeth had also been defended from the Terminids.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nWith Fenrir III liberated, Super Earth High Command spied an opportunity to definitely end its issues with the Terminid Supercolony. On May 26th, 12 scientists at &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; were spaghettified during trials of a new superweapon: &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;The Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;, an technology that had been rescued from the treacherous squids after the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis superweapon would appear to be the only remaining option to effectively deal with the Terminid Supercolony, as many scientists had observed that the Terminids were already too deep inside Meridia's crusts for orbital bombardments to be effective, even if they were to be done using nuclear munitions.\nAs such, Super Earth High Command issued the order for Fenrir III, Angel's Venture and &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; to be held, as these 3 planets would serve as the main path through which to transport all the Dark Fluid necessary to destroy Meridia.\nThen, on June 1st, the green light was given, as the Helldivers deployed onto Meridia in order to drill the Dark Fluid into its surface.\nFenrir III would not see much incident during this operation. However, as the Dark Fluid began disrupting the Supercolony, its spore production increased, leading to many attacks at neighboring planets, Fenrir III among them.\nThen, on June 2nd, 2184, at 15:25 SEST, Meridia would be no more, as the Dark Fluid drilled into it reached supercriticality and provoked Meridia to collapse into itself, forming a black hole that destroyed the entire Meridia system and syphoned away all Terminid interstellar spores within billions of kilometers, leading to the collapse of the Terminid offensive and letting Fenrir III's citizens breathe a sigh of relief.\nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nFollowing the Destruction of Meridia, Fenrir III would remain largely unharmed, as the Terminids were forced to retreat away from the Umlaut Sector. While Fenrir III would be attacked on July 24th, the ongoing operation to cull Terminids would see many Helldivers aid its defense, which helped quickly repel the infestation.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nAmidst this operation, Fenrir III was attacked. On August 11th, with orders to prevent further Terminid advance, the Helldivers deployed onto Fenrir III once more, repelling the insects once again and securing the lives of its colonists once more, while still helping the cause of Liberty.\nOperation Ecologic Immolation.\nFenrir III would have enjoyed 2 months of well-deserved freedom by this point. The Terminids had been successfully contained and the Automaton front was slowly being pushed back. However, it is when Freedom's guard is at its lowest when it is the most vulnerable. And as such, Fenrir III was attacked on August 30th, amidst an operation to liberate &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and killing Automatons for scrap metal.\nWith the Helldivers away at the Western Galactic Rim, Fenrir III would fall to the Terminids the following. However, once the operation concluded, the Helldivers deployed en masse on Fenrir III, liberating it by September 1st.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nAfter those small bouts, Fenrir III stood strong and resilient, its colonists hardened after all the hardships endured. Even in the face of the horrid nebula that had appeared called &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, the strength of Fenrir's colonists didn't wain or waver, instead hardening their resolve.\nThis new resolve would be put to the test when; on November 5th, after 2 months of uninterrupted tranquility, the Terminids attacked Fenrir III, aided by a spore surge coming out of the Gloom. In a mighty show of their courage and resolve, Fenrir III was defended from the Terminids, ensuring that the relocation of colonists displaced from their homes by the Gloom onto the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; continued unimpeded.\nOperation Iron Rain.\nFollowing this last bout with the Terminids, not much else would occur in Fenrir III, its colonists continuing their lives without much incident. However, the Terminids, with their unbridled hatred for peace, would attack Fenrir III without provocation. While this attack was not its cause, Operation Iron Rain would be declared mere hours after the Terminid forces made planetfall, pretty much giving the Helldivers a blank cheque to eradicate any and all bugs through the usage of machine guns, as per the request of the Ministry of Defense in order to conduct research on its efficiency.\nAfter some 30 hours of combat, the Terminids would be successfully rebuked, allowing Fenrir III's population a smooth return to its well-earned respite.\nOperation Wormhole Spaghetti.\nFollowing the conclusion of Operation Squid Game, Astronomers reported novel anomalous phenomena in the form of fluctuations in the event horizon and electromagnetic flares in the vicinity of the Meridian Singularity. Since the exotic substance known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt; was found on Illuminate worlds at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; and was used to collapse the planet into a black hole, High Command concluded that the recent changes to the Meridian Singularity, so shortly following the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt;, may indicate a deeper connection.\nIndeed the Meridian Singularity may be no ordinary black hole, as many leading government experts have long suspected. Naturally these developments demanded further investigation. High Command thus ordered the construction of a new Center of Science on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to decisive Fascism-repulsion operations by the Helldivers in vicinity of Fenrir III, the construction of a new Center of Science was completed safely. Top &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics\"&gt;astrophysicists&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; immediately convened there to closely study the Meridian Singularity and instantly the project yielded valuable insights.\nThe Singularity was not, as many uninformed laypeople had assumed, a typical black hole. It is, in fact, the first observed instance of a wormhole: a tunnel in spacetime connecting two disparate points in space. Much more remains to be investigated as it is likely that the wormhole was formed following the implosion of Meridia by dark matter unclear if the wormhole formed recently, or if it has existed for some time already. A connection to the recent &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; attacks is one of many threads being pursued."}

{"id": "3603", "revid": "37419324", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3603", "title": "First Galactic War", "text": "The First Galactic War, also sometimes referred to as the First Intergalactic War or shortened to GW1, was an intergalactic armed conflict waged by the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation Of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; against the , a race of alien insectoids, the , a race of extra-terrestrial highly advanced, semi-humanoid cephalopods and, after the start of the war, the , an insurgent force comprised of cybernetically-enhanced terrorists that were driven mad by their prosthetic enhancements. \nThe events that occurred in this war are mostly depicted in , as part of the ; however, in Helldivers 2, certain events in the First Galactic War are established to be canon to the franchise's history, leaving the canonicity of the Galactic Campaign uncertain.\nCasus Belli and the Start of the War.\nNot much is known about the specific conditions in which the First Galactic War started, as Helldivers 1 itself opens 40 years after the start of the war. However, some details are given that could shed some light into the specifics of how each faction got into conflict with Super Earth.\nNot much is known about how humanity first entered into contact with the Bugs. A possible explanation is that, during the early expansion of mankind, some colonists unknowingly disturbed a Bug nest, prompting them to attack, which ended up in a cycle of escalation that culminated in the war.\nAt some point, the issue of the Bugs became such that the Helldivers were called in to help, as all other measures had effectively failed to contain the bugs\nThe Illuminate are unique, as they are the only faction that is admitted to have attempted a peace deal before Super Earth delivered the first strike, obviously in self-defence.\nFrom what is told in Helldivers 1, the Illuminate would have been spotted during the early 21st century, as there would be frequent sightings of Illuminate recon spacecraft that would then be passed as folklore. However, at some point between the end of the Great War and 2044, the Illuminate would make the first contact with humanity. \nWhile the government of Super Earth, loving peace as it always does, was more than happy to accept, it would end up making a gruesome discovery: The Illuminate possessed large quantities of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;world-destroying devices&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed \"obliterator bombs\" at the time. Fearing for the safety of its citizens and for the future of Managed Democracy, the government of Super Earth would successfully dispel the malicious illusions of the squid-like beings and launched a pre-emptive strike, knowing that Liberty would not be safe so long as these aliens had more advanced technology than humanity. \nThe only faction that is explicitly stated to have attacked Super Earth first are the Cyborgs. The usual stated reasons for conflict are because of the supposed \"Oppression\" of Cyborgs by the government of Super Earth, which then prompts a terrorist bombing that then forces Super Earth to declare war against the Cyborg Insurrectionists. However, it is also possible that these terrorist incidents are false flag operations, staged in order to allow the Federation a reasonable justification to exterminate cybernetically enhanced citizens.\nNevertheless, in all 3 cases, the common conclusion is the same: Super Earth, in its need to defend Democracy, calls upon the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; for aide in bringing back freedom to a galaxy riddled with tyrants, fascists and socialists that hate liberty.\nCurrently Confirmed Battles &amp; Events of the War.\nIn Helldivers 2, the 3 currently available characters, being the Ship Master, the Service Technician and the Democracy Officer, will sometimes mention the First Galactic War or certain battles from the First Galactic War when the player asks to speak with them. As well, players can sometimes find mentions of certain battles and events taking place during the war when checking the descriptions of certain armors, helmets and weapons. These are the following\nBattle of Liberty Peak.\nOne battle that is brought up in-game is the Battle of Liberty Peak. Not many details are given about it, with the only piece of information that can be inferred being that it was an engagement between the Helldivers and the Bugs, with the obvious result being a decisive Super Earth Victory. The location of Liberty Peak is not shown in the Galactic Map, meaning that this battle perhaps took place at a location with such name inside of one of the planets available in either Helldivers 1 or Helldivers 2. \nOne thing that is known is that the \"Savior of the Free\" Armor is the closest glimpse available at the kind of armor that the Helldivers present that day were outfitted with, as its description states it to be a faithful replica of the armors worn that day. \nBattle of &lt;a href=\"Nublaria%20I\"&gt;Nublaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother confirmed battle in the First Galactic War is the Battle of Nublaria, which presumably took place in &lt;a href=\"Nublaria%20I\"&gt;Nublaria I&lt;/a&gt;, a currently inaccessible planet in the Celeste Sector. Judging by the description, this was an armed engagement between the Super Earth Armed Forces against the Bugs, as the aforementioned \"Jackle 6\" is specified to be a veteran of the \"Viper Commandos\", a military unit of which neither game has ever made any mention of prior to the addition of this armor, though it is possible that this was a special Helldiver Unit given its availability to Helldivers.\nGiven the current state of peace and prosperity on Nublaria, it can be inferred that the Battle resulted in an undisputed victory for Super Earth, with Jackle 6's actions most likely being crucial to this development.\nBattle of Cyberstan.\nA battle that is confirmed in game both through dialogue and by the game itself is the Battle for Cyberstan, a crucial battle between the Super Earth Armed Forces and the Cyborg Separatists. While in Helldivers 1 it is possible to lose this battle, in Helldivers 2 it is shown that the canon result of this battle was a Super Earth victory.\nAfter signing their surrender, the Cyborgs would be sent to the voting stations by force under threat of losing what remained of their civil rights. After the voting, Cyberstan would then be under military occupation for 5 years to prevent further rebellion and lawlessness and, following the occupation, Super Earth would then leave the Cyborgs under \"rehabilitation\" at the mines of Cyberstan, under the ownership of the Super Earth Construction Company.\n&lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; Advanced Weapons Laboratory.\nDuring Operation Starslayer, Super Earth High Command would issue a major order mandating that the Helldivers maintained control of X-45 while search and recovery teams investigated the lightly irradiated ruins of an old weapons lab from this war, its research focused on the production of Interplanetary Battle Stations, meaning it was probably a Super Earth Navy Facility. It is also likely that this facility was a joint military base, intended to house research/other non-combat personnel of the Super Earth Navy and serve as an outpost for Helldiver Commandos, as a cache of fully operational &lt;a href=\"MLS-4X%20Commando\"&gt;MLS-4X Commando&lt;/a&gt; Missile Launchers and blueprints for Tier 5 Super Destroyer upgrades were also found in the planet during the operation, which allowed their fleetwide deployment after the operation concluded.\nThe conditions of how this facility became irradiated and abandoned are never stated, but given the proximity of the planet to Cyberstan it is likely that it was directly related to the conflict that was going on between Super Earth and the Cyborg Insurgency in 2084. Whether it was due to the fallout from a nuclear meltdown or nuclear bombardment is up for debate.\nWhat is made clear is that X-45 was uninhabitable due to the radiation for the 100 year period between the First and Second Galactic Wars, which explains why the planet didn't have any FTL Supply lines connecting it to the rest of its sector until July 2184.\nBattle of &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother confirmed battle of the First Galactic War is the Battle of Choepessa IV, also known as the \"Liberation of Choepessa IV\". This engagement would see the Bugs fight against the Helldivers over control of the once lush, green jungle planet, as its location can make it a handy forward base. According to the description of the \"Purifying Eclipse\" cape from the \"&lt;a href=\"Freedom%27s%20Flame\"&gt;Freedom's Flame&lt;/a&gt;\" Warbond, this battle saw such a heavy usage of orbital ordnance that the resulting cloud of debris and ash would occlude the planet's sun for an entire lunar cycle (29.5 days).\nGoing by the name, it can be inferred that the Bugs would initially overwhelm the planet's defenses but would then be liberated after an unknown amount of time. Judging by the \"heavy usage of orbital ordnance\", it perhaps was shortly after the initial assault.\nJudging by Choepessa IV's status prior to the Second Galactic War and the name it is described by on the previously mentioned source, it is safe to say that this engagement resulted in victory for Super Earth, while also being a possible cause for the glaciation that made Choepessa IV into the icy boneyard planet it is by 2184.\nBattle of &lt;a href=\"Squ%27bai%20Shrine\"&gt;Squ'bai Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nA battle that is not mentioned anywhere in Helldivers 2 but makes an appearance in Helldivers 1 is the Battle of Squ'bai Shrine, the homeworld of the Illuminate during the First Galactic War. While in Helldivers 1 it is possible for the community to be defeated in this battle, the current state of the galaxy in Helldivers 2 confirms that this battle ended in victory for Super Earth. After being defeated, the Illuminate would sign a peace treaty with the Federation of Super Earth and subsequently abandon the Milky Way, never to return.\nSqu'bai Shrine is currently not present in the Galactic War Map.\nBattle of &lt;a href=\"Outpost%2032\"&gt;Outpost 32&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutpost 32, a planet in the Saleria Sector, was presumably part of the Cyborg front during the First Galactic War. Not much is known about how this battle developed, as it is only mentioned through a poster than can sometimes appear plastered on buildings in Helldivers 2. The poster depicted of an Automaton Devastator overlooking the burning ruins of a Super Citizen's home, along with a ragged, flag in the middle and the phrase \"Remember Outpost 32\" could imply that Outpost 32 was either a great defeat that would eventually be corrected after the Battle of Cyberstan or a victory that came at a tremendous cost (for SEAF standards).\nIt should be noted that Outpost 32 is not even a possible planet to play on Helldivers 1, which raises questions about whether or not this battle even occured or if it was fabricated by the federation in order to raise support for the campaigns against the Automatons in the Second Galactic War.\nNevertheless, this battle is now grimly present in the minds of the colonists of not only Outpost 32, but also the entire Saleria sector, given the return of the nefarious Illuminate.\nBattle of &lt;a href=\"Kepler%20Prime\"&gt;Kepler Prime&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother battle that is not mentioned anywhere in Helldivers 2 but makes an appearance in Helldivers 1 is the Battle of Kepler Prime, the homeworld of the Bugs during the First Galactic War. While it is possible for the community to be defeated in this battle, the state of the galaxy prior to February 2184 in Helldivers 2 confirms that this battle ended in victory for Super Earth.\nKepler Prime is currently not present in the Galactic War Map.\nEnd of the War.\nBy 2084, Super Earth had successfully defeated all of its enemies. The Bugs would be successfully contained into E-710 farms, in which they would then be subjected to genetic experimentation and selective breeding in order to increase E-710 production, with the result being the Bugs' rapid evolution into the present in &lt;a href=\"Helldivers%202\"&gt;Helldivers 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cyborgs, as previously mentioned, would be defeated and interned in Cyberstan as punishment until a new foe, the would seemingly invade the planet, their current fate being unknown.\nThe Illuminate, after the battle of Squ'bai Shrine, would end up signing a peace treaty with Super Earth, the terms of which forced them to surrender all of their technology and weapons to the Federation of Super Earth, amongst which was technology allowing for Faster-Than-Light travel and the Dark fluid, a mysterious superweapon capable of collapsing planets into black holes, as displayed in &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. However, having spent 100 years in exile, these Squ'ith would then come back to enact vengeance onto Super Earth once more, as the suddenly attacked the urban colonies of &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; on December 12th, 2184.\nAftermath and Consequences of the War.\nThe years following the First Galactic War saw the rapid and unopposed expansion of Super Earth through the Milky Way, in part thanks to the FTL Travel Technology obtained from the Illuminate. As the years passed, the Helldivers were deactivated as a new era of peace and prosperity ushered in for humanity, as they believed they would not need to call upon the Helldivers again.\nAccording to the PA Announcer in one of the randomized TV Ads in the Super Destroyers in Helldivers 2, the Bugs were responsible for 189,000,000 civilian casualties, with a significant portion of those being human babies. This could explain why, by the time of the Second Galactic War, civilian society is so accustomed to the glorification of violence towards the Terminids.\nThe Illuminate and the Cyborgs, thought decisively defeated by Super Earth, would be reduced to mere boogeyman for parents to use across the Federation in cautionary tales they would recite to their children as they raised them into proper citizens of the Federation.\nWhile it is not shown in neither game, the canonical result of the Battle of Cyberstan suggests that the few Cyborgs that remained not only continued to suffer discrimination, but would also be held under bondage (if not complete subservience) to the Super Earth Construction Company, being mostly relegated to concentration camps within Cyberstan's surface."}

In 2084, this projection was centered around the Caribbean, specifically on the Gulf of Mexico close to Sector 7, while in 2184, the flag was updated, now featuring an azimuthal projection of Earth centered on Prosperity City, the capital of the Federation (formerly called Stockholm). Both versions of this projection are in white\nCrowning said projection of earth is a (possible) depiction of the Presidential Palace, which has been datamined but has never been shown in game.\nAs its supporter, there is a simplified yellow wreath, with a sequence of 7 starts right underneath, serving as its compartment.\nPossible Meanings.\nAffectionately named \"The White, Yellow, Blue\" by the majority of the population, the Flag of Super Earth's design has many potential interpretations. Here, some of the most plausible has been listed.\nAccording to traditional vexillology, the Blue field could represent the vastness of the cosmos, in which Super Earth stands at its center, serving as a beacon of hope, peace, liberty and prosperity that all other alien species should aspire to.\nThe white emblem could represent Super Earth's role as an agent of order and harmony, dispensing peace upon all planets and sectors within its reach, as well as serving as a reminder of its mission to pacify the galaxy so that all sentient human species may coalesce and exist in harmony and Managed Democracy.\nThe yellow wreath featured since 2184 may represent the prosperity which Super Earth has accomplished after its grandiose victory, as well as the prosperity it aims to disseminate across the known universe. It could also represent the Helldivers themselves, who are the guardians of humankind and heroes of Super Earth.\nThe 7 stars at the bottom of the emblem could represent each of the 7 sectors, while the crowning symbol at the top could represent the President of Super Earth or the Democratic Council.\nHistory.\nThe first flag of Super Earth during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; used a different emblem with no stars, a white wreath and centred on the Caribbean. This flag was most likely adopted upon the Proclamation of the Federation of Super Earth and, given the many decades that this conflict lasted, it was preserved due to convenience. \nThe second version of the flag has the seven stars in a straight line getting smaller for the centre instead of being curved around the globe, there is also four towers at the top of the emblem instead of three. It can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;Main Objectives&lt;/a&gt;, houses, &lt;a href=\"Extraction\"&gt;Extraction&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers 2 background, the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; background and the galactic war table.\nThe third version of the flag has no gold rings and was seen on the mission accomplished poster after the defeat of the Automaton Vanguard.\nThe Fourth version of the flag is seen in the games intro, it has a altered emblem that is missing the Mediterranean Sea. It is theorised that Super Earth drained the Mediterranean but this is false as it can be seen on the World Map.\nIn during the Capture Area , the flag used had the helldivers colours with the Super Earth emblem in the middle."}

It is a planet similar to Vernen Wells, with red sand and tall, imposing plateaus. It serves as one of the 2 border planets with the neighbouring Mirin Sector (the other being nearby &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;), as it has the only FTL Line towards &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nMuch like the previously mentioned &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, Fori Prime is an arid red desert, rich in iron and other minerals that have given the sand its velvet color. Amidst the crimson dunes, tall plateaus dot the horizon, as they can span sizes similar to Super Earth's continents, suggesting possible ancient aquatic activity. Most of the flora consists of dry bushes and shrubs, and the occasional small dead trees.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nFori Prime would be under Terminid occupation from the very start of the year 2184. It would endure horrors beyond description that, for the purposes of brevity, we will forgo describing. Fori Prime would lay in bondage, yearning for liberation until the light of Liberty shun on it from the horizon. Shortly after the installation of the Terminid Control System on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would finally be able to push farther east, allowing them to access the Draco and Mirin Sectors.\nOperation Prime Liberation.\nAs demand increased for civilian population expansion and energy sources, Super Earth would see the opportunity to fulfill these needs in the Draco and Mirin Sectors. As such, Super Earth High Command issued a major order for the liberation of Fori Prime and &lt;a href=\"Zagon%20Prime\"&gt;Zagon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. While Fori Prime would be easily captured, Zagon Prime proved unable to be captured on time, which led to all C-01 forms being denied until further notice.\nOperation CBCT Protection.\nDespite the previous failure, a new order would be issued. The Helldivers were to obtain and maintain control of Fori Prime, alongside &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, for 3 days while Civilian Biomass Collection teams acquired inert Terminids for research purposes. While most of the other planets were relatively easy to keep under control, Fori Prime and Hellmire would prove challenging to maintain, with Fori Prime's defense being consistently tested due to constant assault from Oshaune.\nOperation Enduring Bulwark.\nThings would only turn for the worse for the remote red planet, as the war soon escalated. Shortly after their complete obliteration on Malevelon Creek in April, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; would return in even bigger numbers on the West, taking over Cyberstan and the rest of the Valdis Sector. And to make matters worse, the Terminids, in an act of sinister coordination with the mechanized foes, would also launch one great offensive in the East.\nDespite this incredible, dual-fronted assault, the Helldivers would once more prove themselves the unbreakable shield of mankind, managing to hold the line against dozens of assaults, both bot and bug, with planets like Estanu withstanding up to 5 consecutive assaults. Fori Prime would see its own Terminid Assault during this operation, with its defense resulting in a huge success, in part thanks to the timely liberation of neighboring &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;, which was the main supply source for the Terminid assault on Fori Prime.\nFrom here on, Fori Prime's situation would go from a matter of occupation to a matter of holding Fori Prime for as long as possible. Due to its remoteness and other, bigger developments throughout April and especially May of 2184, Fori Prime would see virtually all Helldiver presence in it cease completely, leaving it undefended and, eventually, allowing it to be captured by the Terminids.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAs May 2184 rolled in, things soured in the Terminid Front. With the failure of the Terminid Control System and the apparition of the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridian Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, the Terminid onslaught in the East reached a critical, intolerable level. Fori Prime and the rest of the Draco Sector quickly fell to the bolstered bug assault and would remain in bondage for the whole month.\nIt would have seemed that all hope was lost for the red planet, which had so far only tasted but a drop of the glorious ambrosia of Managed Democracy. However, Liberty's will was for Fori Prime to have a second chance.\n12 scientists would be tragically spaghettified at Moradesh on May 29th, as the SEAF gave the green light to Operation Enduring Peace. It's goal: To use the Dark Fluid, an Illuminate superweapon capable of collapsing planets into black holes, on Meridia. Then on the late hours of May 30th, the news would break: The Helldivers had successfully destroyed the abominable Supercolony, crippling the augmented Terminid wave and allowing for a counterattack.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nAfter a swift re-establishment of freedom on the Umlaut Sector and some much needed victories on the Automaton Front, Super Earth High Command would give a new major order. The Helldivers were to reliberate Hellmire, Estanu, Crimsica, Nivel 43 and Fori Prime.\nCrimsica would be liberated first, on June 16th. Then followed Estanu on the 17th. Then, finally, Fori Prime would be liberated once again on June 18th, with Oshaune and Hellmire being selected as the next targets for liberation. However, the Terminids were determined to maintaining their hold over the red planet, as they quickly launched a counterattack on Fori Prime on the morning of June 19th. After a great deal of death, Super Earth held the planet and it is now classified as a \"Frontline World Against Evil.\"\nFalstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nAnd true to its new classification, Fori Prime would soon endure another assault. However, the planet would only find misfortune, as it would be assaulted while the Helldivers were diverted to the defense of the Xzar Sector. It would fall shortly and then get stuck in a deadlock for a couple days before then, around June 29th, sending an outburst of Terminid Spores towards Crimsica, which successfully overwhelmed its defenses.\nOperation Andromeda.\nFori Prime would remain resistant to liberation and, once the Helldivers were diverted away to fight the Automatons, it would serve as a launching pad for the Terminids to invade Estanu yet again in July, successfully cutting Fori Prime off."}

Ammunition pickups will only replenish 2 grenades, while supply pickups restore 4.

Planet features frequent but small elevation changes from rocky hills into waterlogged channels and reservoirs. Helldivers should exercise caution, as the waters are treacherous. What from distance may look like ankle deep water, is in reality a very deep lake that one can very easy drown in mere seconds after stepping off from the shoreline.\nThe planet is also dotted with ancient fossilized trees, some reaching far above the current tree line. The Massive amounts of evergreen block line of sight, but they can be use as reliable cover thanks to their sheer thickness. Additionally, the planet features a network of gas vents, located randomly throughout the surface. Yellowish in color and emiting a green smoke, any kind of fire or bullet ignites it, causing a fiery explosion in their proximity.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nLocated in remote part of Jin Xi Sector, this planet avoided the wave of &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; infestation during the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Firebreak\"&gt;Meridian Supercolony Crisis&lt;/a&gt; that spilled from &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt; in early June of 2184. Once the crisis receded, its FTL Supply Lines would be restored on June 13th.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nOn June 20th, 2184, local colony officials confirmed landing of Terminid Spores, later calculated to have arrived from &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; through what appears to be a newly created FTL Line. The defenses collapsed on the midnight of June 21st, prompting the immediate calls for a liberation campaign of the swampy planet. The planet has sadly been stuck in a stalemate ever since, as other operations with higher priority have required Helldivers be diverted away from it.\nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nFrom June 21st onwards, Gacrux had been stuck in a deadlock thatonly helped sabotage the valiant peacekeeping efforts of the Helldivers, mostly by helping reignite any outbreaks in the Jin Xi Sector. However, its fate would be sealed once its assault onto Acamar IV was flipped on its head. After its spores hopped from Acamar IV onto &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, they would be quickly repelled and, as Operation Righteous Expunge was completed, the Helldivers would launch an assault onto Acamar IV, which would result in its liberation on the late hours of July 22nd. Then, on July 23rd, a surge of Helldivers turned up to Gacrux to finally put an end to its wretched Terminid problem once and for all.\nGacrux would see lots of bloody combat, as the Terminids put on display their unfettered savagery. Nevertheless, the Helldivers would come out victorious, liberating Gacrux on the evening of July 24th.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nFrom July 24th to August 13th, Gacrux would remain under the warm embrace of Super Earth, its colonists doing what they could to rebuild their settlements and refortify their colonies, left in ruins after the Terminid outbreak. However, these works would be cut short as, due to the diversion of the Helldivers towards the final liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;, Gacrux would be left underdefended. With The Gloom looming over the galactic horizon, the Terminids would use their new nebulous cover to prepare their fiendish plans. \nOn the early hours of August 12th, the Terminids in &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and Fori Prime launched a dual assault onto Acamar IV and Gacrux. The Helldivers that remained in the Eastern Front would flood into Acamar IV, hoping for a quick liberation so that they could also liberate Gacrux before resuming the campaigns in the Western Front. However, the Terminids at Acamar IV would present heavy resistance to the application of peace and, consequently, delayed the success of Acamar's defense enough to make Gacrux fall into their devious appendages by the early hours of August 13th, mere hours after Acamar IV's defense successfully repelled its own Terminid assault.\nOperation Ring Of Freedom.\nGacrux would remain caught in a bloody stalemate for months on end, never being either fully lost nor liberated for any significant period of time, with the only time gap where it didn't see Helldiver presence being from August 22nd to August 24th. Throughout the course of the Galactic War, many operations would surge that would keep Gacrux at the very bottom of the list of objectives, even as The Gloom appeared and encroached upon Fori Prime and threatened to expand upon it.\nHowever, fate soon would change for the swampy planet as, soon, the Helldivers would begin to work towards the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, and with it came the construction of the Xenoentomology Center at Turing that was required for the research and development of better Alcubierre drives to allow the new DSS to perform FTL Warp Travels. And this new Xenoentomology Center required a Terminid Research Preserve in order to study the Terminids and how to make them produce the most E-710 possible.\nBut this preserve couldn't be allowed to be connected to the main Terminid brood and much less to the Gloom. As such, a safety perimeter was to be established around Acamar IV.\nDespite Gacrux's immediate proximity to Acamar and to The Gloom through its FTL line with Fori Prime, it wouldn't see any significant Helldiver action until October 14th, shortly after the victory at &lt;a href=\"Darius%20II\"&gt;Darius II&lt;/a&gt; and the defense of &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;. Being the last objective planet and infamous for its swamps, the Helldivers rushed to capture Gacrux as quickly as possible so that they wouldn't need to stay on it longer than needed. As such, Gacrux would see up to 35,000 Super Destroyers, around 67% of the Helldiver Corps at the time, exclusively devoted to deploying ordnance onto the planet.\nBy the morning of October 15th, Gacrux had been thoroughly liberated, with its security seemingly assured given how The Gloom had stopped expanding weeks prior. \nOperation Crossroads.\nHowever, it wasn't fated for Gacrux's liberty to last. A mere 9 days after its liberation, the Terminids, aided by a spore surge coming out of the Gloom, would mount an offensive headed directly for the Terminid Research Preserve. However, this offensive took place around the same time that the Jet Brigade had shown signs to be planning an offensive, with &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; appearing to be from where it would launch. Having been given the decision of whether to capture Lesath or defend the Terminid Research Preserve, the Helldivers made the difficult choice of abandoning the Terminid Front in order to capture Lesath and secure it from a potential Jet Brigade attack.\nGacrux would be attacked on October 23rd from Partion, with Pandion-XXIV being attacked from Phact Bay merely hours later. Despite a detachment of Helldivers being left behind, the Terminid attack managed to punch through by October 24th, leaving the Terminid Research Preserve Vulnerable.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nGacrux would remain under Terminid occupation for 6 days, as the Helldivers were forced to fight through Phact Bay and Pandion-XXIV before getting to the swamp planet, as the FTL Line from Acamar IV had been pre-emptively shut down in order to prevent an outbreak in the Terminid Research Preserve. However, Gacrux's liberation would be delayed because of ongoing offensives in the Automaton front constantly diverting huge chunks of Helldivers away in order to keep them from expanding.\nGacrux's liberation would come too late, as the constant delays in its liberation; product of the difficult fight against the Automatons at Matar Bay, Demiurg and Curia, would ultimately slow down Gacrux's liberation enough for the order's time limit to pass, making Operation Adamant Resolve a technical failure. However, the Helldivers would still wind up liberating the planet on November 3rd, securing the Terminid Research Preserve against any attacks for the time being.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nGacrux would remain free of any Terminid presence after its liberation. It would seem that, after all, things hadn't come to boil despite the tactical miscalculation during Operation Crossroads. But the seeds of fascism had already been sown on the Terminid Research Preserve, and it was only a matter of time before their bore their nefarious fruits.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nExpectedly, with the Helldivers focused on saving the critical research material at Turing, Gacrux would be lost to the Terminids by the afternoon of the following day, in a massive disaster that took millions of lives and undid all the progress achieved in the past 3 months."}
{"id": "5968", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5968", "title": "Gaellivare", "text": "Gaellivare is one of the four planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus Sector&lt;/a&gt;. After being liberated on September 27th, 2184, it was chosen as the main construction site for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt would see the construction of the Democracy Space Station through and, from November 13th to November 17th, was the site of a great battle between the Helldiver Corps and the Automaton Jet Brigade. Despite the defeat, the Helldivers managed to safely evacuate the DSS away from the Automatons, guaranteeing its safety and safeguarding its power well within Super Earth's control.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;. The climate on Gaellivare is both very humid and very wet, with lots of precipitation. Helldivers deployed to the planet will find that it rains\u2026 a lot, to say the least.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nGaellivare had been a peaceful colony of Super Earth for many decades at this point, having been settled at some point after the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. Its colonists thrived throughout the many jungles and prospered thanks to the fertility of the soil around the volcanoes. However, the Automatons, in their unquenchable thirst for resources and their innate hatred for Super Earth, would thrust Gaellivare into the war by force.\nWhen the Automaton Legions invaded the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and began their territorial expansion in April and May 2184. Gaellivare's Colonial Overseer would order that all of its supply lines leading into neighboring sectors were closed, which helped safeguard the Talus Sector against the horrors that the Automatons had brought upon other planet colonies farther away.\nAs the months passed, Gaellivare's colonists would fortify their settlements and stockpile weapons, with the hopes of the Helldivers rescuing them as the robotic threat built up in Lesath, right at the doorstep of their new home planet.\nThey hoped that they would not need to use their defences against the robots. But little did they know that these defences would pave the way for their salvation.\nOn September 6th, 2184, the Automaton forces in Lesath, mere days after their vanguard in &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and Mastia was cut off, would launch an assault onto Gaellivare, timed almost perfectly with a secondary assault that the Automaton vanguard in Mastia launched onto &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt;, as the Automatons seeked to utilize Imber's vast deposits of titanium in order to construct a new, unknown fighting force.\nSince the colonists in Shelt had been unable to properly prepare, the Helldivers would see themselves in the need to deploy to Shelt immediately in order to rescue its under-prepared defenders and prevent the Automatons from getting to Imber. However, this would leave Gaellivare to their own devices until Shelt could be secured.\nHowever, despite the victory at Shelt, the Helldivers were unable to successfully defend Gaellivare, with the assailants having already made too much progress in their invasion to really be driven back. Gaellivare would fall on the 8th of September, immediately starting an assault on Imber, as the Automaton forces punched through the planet. Through Gaellivare, the Automatons would go on to resupply their vanguard at Mastia before attempting 3 assaults at Imber, with the last one happening shortly before the end of Operation Liberty Tide and causing the loss of both the planet and the major order.\nOperation Leap Forward.\nAfter months of intense research, on the 25th of September, 2184, construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; was finally ready to begin. The DSS promised to be a powerful strategic tool for reshaping the Galactic Map \u2014 democratically directed by the Helldivers themselves. However to actually construct the DSS, an orbital construction site must first be secured.\nOf the planets within Super Earth's reach, only two two have large enough magnetospheres for safe construction: Gaellivare and &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;. Both of which were under &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; control.\nThough the final choice of which to liberate was ultimately left to the Helldivers, Gaellivare was the more strategically viable choice. Although the planet would no doubt receive counter attacks from &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;, Gaellivare was also much closer to the active galactic front-line when compared to Clasa, which would have required the liberation of both &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; to properly defend, not to mention the marked distaste of swamp planets amongst the corps. Thus the majority of helldivers deployed onto Gaellivare.\nDespite the losses of Imber, &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; on the Terminid Front and Shelt throughout the 4 days during which the Helldivers fought over an unusually fortified Automaton force at Gaellivare, it would be finally captured on September 27th. Once the DSS Logistics Hub would be built on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; in order to streamline the allocation of construction materials and resources towards the Democracy Space Station.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nGaellivare would see the Automatons for the last time on September 27th, as the Helldivers secured it for the construction of the Democracy Space Station. For 2 months, Gaellivare enjoyed peace and prosperity like no other, as its population centupled and its economy flourished, with millions of construction workers pouring in from all over the galaxy as the construction went on smoothly.\nHowever, it would be at the last second when Gaellivare would see its 2 months of well-earned peace come to an end. On November 11th; just as the Democracy Space Station was about to come online, the Jet Brigade, a special strike force of the Automatons that had been crafted through the use of metal gathered from throughout their fief and the desecration fallen Helldivers off their Jump Packs, would return. Having been defeated at &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; on September 22nd, this repugnant force had been rebuilt and given 58 Automaton Battalions with one express purpose: Conquering Gaellivare and destroying the Democracy Space Station.\nOn November 12th, the Jet Brigade would brutally conquer Tarsh and destroy the DSS Logistics Hub, then on November 13th followed Mastia, despite a heroic sacrifice from an SEAF platoon from Lesath.\nThen, hours after the fall of Mastia's defense, the Jet Brigade attacked, with 47 Automaton Battalions behind it. Gaellivare's SEAF garrison, having enjoyed lots of time and resources to reinforce and prepare for the eventual return of the Automatons, would send the call for Helldiver aid, as they estimated that they would last about 48 hours before the Automatons took over the planet. However, events would soon take a wild turn from a side they did not expect.\nAmidst the heroic defense of Gaellivare, at 21:37 SEST, the Helldivers would manage to acquire enough E-710 to activate the DSS, having acquired it after the collapse of the Terminid Research Preserve at Acamar IV. With the Democracy Space Station active, Gaellivare would be able to defend itself against the Automatons.\nFor the rest of the night and into November 14th, the Helldivers and the SEAF fought valiantly to repel the Automaton Jet Brigade, but the situation continued to look more and more grim. However, High Command would spy an opportunity in Mastia, as its capture would possibly end the assault on Gaellivare, as the Jet Brigade would be cut off from its supply line.\nAs such, the Helldivers voted to move the Democracy Space Station to Mastia, where they would then enable the Planetary Bombardment. For the rest of November 14th, the defense at Gaellivare would continue to fight the Jet Brigade as best as it could, as the main fleet of the Helldivers moved back to Mastia to attempt its capturing before it was too late. Some dissidents have suggested this manoeuvre was more motivated more motivated by strategic miscommunication to the nature of the DSS's voting system &amp; that splitting Helldiver forces between 2 hard fought warzones was a catastrophic blunder, fortunately Ministry of Truth officials were able to quickly crack down on such thoughtcrime, even during the conflict.\nHowever, this effort still would not be enough, as Mastia was still too reinforced to break in time. As such, the Helldivers had to get creative and voted to move the DSS back to Gaellivare, where they would then activate the Eagle Storm. With the assistance of the Democracy Space Station, the advance of the Jet Brigade would be slowed to a halt, which allowed the Helldivers to relocate back to Gaellivare to continue fighting, now being able to properly counterattack and, hopefully, come out victorious. This also resulted in the majority of Helldivers following the DSS back to Gaellivare, abandoning the Gambit at Mastia thus rendering the previous days fighting a waste of time whilst. \nThis comment redacted for treason.\nWhile Gaellivare would be held within the operation's timeframe, the battle was still not over. The fate of Gaellivare, and the Democracy Space Station, still depended on the outcome of this defense.\nHowever, dissidence had grown among the Helldiver Corps, and with dissidence came indecision to violently replace the Helldivers' usual focus and efficiency. For many hours, they fought against the paralyzed Jet Brigade, racing to try and take enough ground to gain the upper hand before the Democracy Space Station's blockade had to be lifted. Yet, the enemy numbers where just too great.\nDespite all of the many millions of lives lost after 3 days on continuous battle, the Helldivers had been unable to overtake the Jet Brigade. The enemy was incredibly numerous and the Helldivers hadn't been able to properly manoeuvre around them despite all their best efforts.\nOnce the Democracy Space Station left for &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, the main Helldiver fleet went away with it. Gaellivare was doomed.\nEven with all of their might, the Helldivers had managed to fight the Jet Brigade for long enough to move the Democracy Space Station beyond their reach but not long enough to defeat them. Gaellivare would ultimately fall at 6:22 SEST - EST, leaving the Helldivers greatly defeated and all of the heroic martyrs that gave their lives for Super Earth waiting to be justfully avenged.\nWhile Operation Spark of Liberty would be successful, as Gaellivare was still within Super Earth Control for long enough to allow the DSS to escape from the Automatons, this small victory had come at a cost too great: The complete collapse of the Terminid Front, product of the disastrous breach at Acamar IV, and the campaign against the Jet Brigade itself had resulted in the loss of 8 planets across 5 sectors, with the civilian casualties in the hundreds of millions and the damages very well into the tens of billions of Super Credits.\nOperation Spark of Liberty, despite its pyrrhic victory, was a complete military disaster.\nOperation Balance of Liberty.\nIn order to recoup the brutal yet absolutely necessary losses sustained while Super Earth focussed on the DSS's construction, the Ministry of Defense put the vital superweapon to immediate use retaking lost ground, putting out a Major Order to all Helldivers to Liberate more planets than they lost over the orders duration. \nStill stinging from the desperate battle for Gaellivare, the Helldivers immediately cast their gaze back to the lost world as their first target of attack, voting the DSS back into the planets orbit a day after it left to stubbornly ensure the planet's liberation. \nHowever, as the Jet Brigade left to assault nearby Imber. The valiant liberation of Gaellivare would become an even more valiant endeavour, retaking Gaellivare while the Jet Brigade where still using it as a staging grounds would cut their assault force off from their supply lines. Not only resulting in the ensured freedom of both worlds, but wiping clean the stains of both the loss of Gaellivare &amp; the failed Mastia Gambit.\nThe fighting on Gaellivare would be as bitter as it was a few days prior, with vengeful Helldivers refusing to back down a second time, High Command would deploy free Airburst Missile Launcher to all Helldivers during this time in order to observe if the rate at which they caused tragic yet unavoidable friendly fire incidents was still at acceptable levels, most would be put to use here, blasting devastator &amp; diver alike to smithereens in a brutal battle to save 2 planets at once.\nTragically Gaellivare would only be liberated to 95% by the time it's neighbour fell. Returning to Liberty's arms but a few hours too late to save Imber from tyranny. \nDespite this, the victory at Gaellivare would effectively sever the Jet Brigade off their supply line, leaving them encircled at Imber, their numbers severely demolished from their string of odious conquests. As such, with the DSS now operational, the Helldivers would begin to reroute their forces towards Imber, as the contingent left at the Terminid front began to re-route towards &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;.

Given its foggy, swampy environment, its colonists spent much of their time paddling makeshift rafts and canoes down the swamps to fish and using the few patches of fertile, livable land to build their settlements and farms.\nHowever, despite its innocuous, peaceful nature, the, being soulless, fascistic insects, would have no appreciation for such simplistic pleasures. During Operation Overrun, Gar Haren's FTL Lines to neighboring Gatria and Phact Bay would be restored as the Ministry of Expansion seeked to increase colonization efforts on the otherwise unremarkable planet. \nIt would be because of this interest from the Ministry that the SEAF would be tasked with ensuring Gar Haren's security, alongside with that of Phact Bay and Gatria amidst a Terminid outbreak produced by the Gloom, an intergalactic nebula made up of Terminid Interstellar spores that appeared around Socorro III some weeks prior.\nHowever, Operation Overrun would go remarkably well for the Helldivers, as they managed to successfully repel all attacks that were coming towards both Phact Bay and Gatria despite the massive Terminid numbers. As such, Gar Haren's colonists would mostly only spend their time building light fortifications and stockpiling moderate amounts of weapons that would mostly remained stashed in scattered depots.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nHowever, this peace was not going to last forever. As the months passed and the Helldivers were diverted elsewhere, the Terminids seemed to have learned, now pouncing onto planets when the Helldivers weren't looking. Such was the case for Phact Bay, which fell on September 28th after 2 days of fierce fighting against a Terminid assault from &lt;a href=\"Partion\"&gt;Partion&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the Terminids at Phact Bay would go on to successfully invade &lt;a href=\"Darius%20II\"&gt;Darius II&lt;/a&gt; on September 29th.\nThe painting was clear on the wall and, fittingly, the colonists in Gar Haren began to make preparations for an invasion, while the Terminids in Phact Bay would go back to then send another assault onto &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; on September 30th, not even a full week after its excruciating liberation. While this first assault would be repelled, the bugs at Phact Bay would withdray to regain their strength, while an assault from Gacrux would ultimately overwhelm Pandion on October 7th.\nWith Pandion scratched off its list, the only remaining ways for Super Earth to attack the Terminid broods at Phact Bay were Gatria and Gar Haren. However, Gatria had proven to be very defensible against the Bugs, having never been lost to the Terminids through an assault in all of the Second Galactic War so far. As such, using their maleficent instinct, the Bugs instead opted for their other, more strategically valuable target: Gar Haren\nGar Haren had just opened a new FTL line with Achernar Secundus, which itself linked back to &lt;a href=\"Ursica%20XI\"&gt;Ursica XI&lt;/a&gt;, itself linking to &lt;a href=\"Achird%20III\"&gt;Achird III&lt;/a&gt; which, ultimately, led to &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the new Xenoentomology Center that had been constructed as part of the Democracy Space Station project.\nThus, on October 12th, the Terminids launched the first assault ever onto Gar Haren. This assault, despite a valiant defense from the Helldivers, would punch through on October 13th and then immediately head towards Achernar Secundus, as the Terminids aimed to reach Achird III with all they had.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nGar Haren would be under Terminid control ever since its fall, as the Helldivers were constantly diverted away towards other, more important, targets. However, Gar Haren would catch a glance of hope from an unexpected side.\nOn November 14th, after the tragedy at Acamar IV had caused the total collapse of the Terminid front, Gar Haren's Terminid hatcheries experienced a sudden extinction event, and no Terminids eggs would be there to replenish the fallen, which left Gar Haren's Terminid broods unable to undo any progress towards the planet's liberation.\nAs such, a small Helldiver contingent on the planet began to slowly make progress towards the planet, as all other forces were focused on keeping Gaellivare, and the Democracy Space Station, away from the Automatons.\nOperation Balance of Liberty.\nEven after the pyrrhic victory with the Democracy Space Station and all the losses in the Terminid Front, Gar Haren would continue its slow but steady progress towards liberation. However, where a small contingent had picked up the ball and gotten it rolling, the Helldiver Corps would soon get it all the way to the finish line, like a tortoise racing a hare.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; was liberated on November 20th, the Helldiver Corps immediately rotated towards Gar Haren, hoping to liberate it in time to rotate towards more critical planets such as &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;.\nGar Haren would be finally liberated on November 22nd without much fanfare or strife, allowing its colonists to resume their peaceful lives.\nInterim (December 16th - ).\nGar Haren would remain in peace following its liberation, without much events happening to it. It would remain safeguarded against a Terminid offensive during Operation Bughammer until, suddenly, all Helldivers were ordered towards &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; and, essentially, left all the fronts unmanned. The reason was nothing short of an event that rightfully demanded every available soldier in the SEAF: The had returned and were now invading Calypso.\nAs such, the Terminids would capture Gatria on December 14th leaving Gar Haren exposed. Then, 2 days later, the Terminids sent a spore barrage onto Gar Haren. However, their attack couldn't have been more poorly timed, since the Helldivers would come out of the battle at Calypso victorious and reinforced. Around 33,000 Super Destroyers immediately set course to Gar Haren, determined to drive the Terminids away from the planet and even farther away.\nFor the first 20 hours of the onslaught, the Helldivers would manage to hold their position with a comfortable ease. However, things would soon turn south when the Illuminate started a second, much larger offensive on the Southern Galactic Rim, requiring all Helldivers to divert back towards the endangered planets and allowing the Terminids an opening, ultimately allowing them to overrun the planetary defenses. However, with the capture of Gar Haren, the Terminids appear to have reached a dead end, as enemy resistance was pretty much null."}
{"id": "5595", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5595", "title": "Gatria", "text": " is one of the six planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Jin Xi-Falstaff Lockdown.\nGatria was, up until June 2184, a peaceful planet colony in the Jin Xi Sector, its colonists thriving amongst the crimson grasslands, herding Terminids and producing E-710 without much trouble. However, all it takes is one small spark of tyranny for a haystack of freedom to be lost to the flames of fascism.\nDue to unknown reasons, a spontaneous Terminid outbreak would immediately overrun Gatria amidst a lockdown of the Jin Xi and Falstaff sectors, ordered by the Super Earth High Command shortly after victory at &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Enduring Peace. The savage insectoids could not have chosen any worse time to pounce onto innocent Gatria with such viciousness.\nStarting on June 30th, shortly after the fall of Crimsica, the Helldivers would begin to send small combat groups towards Gatria in order to begin culling the numbers of the Terminids while the operation was ongoing. Then, once the lockdown was lifted after the successful capture of &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would divert towards Gatria in greater numbers, but still facing heavy resistance, with victory only coming by July 11th after heavy casualties.\nOperation Overrun.\nGatria, given its distance from frontline planets like &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, would remain peaceful following its liberation, its colonists beginning resettlement and repairs in an attempt to return to normal. However, the Terminids, genetically envious of peace and prosperity, would force Gatria back into the war from a side they would not expect.\nThe nearby Sten Sector had been lost during the initial Terminid outbreak in February 2184. By September 1st, 2184, Gatria hadn't been connected to the Sten Sector for months. However, its colonists would finish their lunch and find a horrid surprise. The Terminids nestled in Trandor had suddenly made planetfall on Gatria and were now invading the planet. Super Earth High Command would issue a Major Order for the defense of Gatria, Phact Bay and recently reconnected Gar Haren.\nHelldivers immediately began deploying to the scarlet world, defending colonists of all citizenship ratings from the fascist menace. The defense was swift, and by the evening of September 2nd, clean up operations would already begin in earnest. But this was just the beginning, as around 06:00 SEST of September 3rd, a massive cloud of spores reached Gatria system from Trandor, heralding another defense campaign. Scanners both orbital and on-the-ground confirmed the density of said cloud among the greatest recorded, only being second to the Terminid Superonslaught encountered in &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; weeks prior by mere quirk of the numbers. \nThe colonists of Gatria would find themselves fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Colonial Defense Force and almost every Helldiver in the corps as they combined their forces to take on the enormous Terminid onslaught that pounced upon their sufficiently sized homes, for they had already suffered too much just for a pack of alien insects to snatch their hard work off their hands without consequence. \nGatria would successfully repell the second Terminid Superonslaught without much incident, securing it firmly under the control of Freedom for the remainder of the operation. \nOperation Critical Mass.\nGatria would be attacked one more time during Operation Critical Mass. However, this poorly timed attack by the Terminids would only result in failure, as the Helldivers, having orders to cull the bulk of the Terminid forces such as Warriors and Bile Spewers, would deliver a great display of Super Earth's military might, repelling the invading bugs for a fourth time and in under 12 hours.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nHowever, the Terminids in Trandor seemed to be incapable of surrendering to Managed Democracy, as some 4 days later, they would launch yet another attack onto Gatria. This time, the result would be no different, with the Helldivers successfully repelling a fifth Terminid attack onto Gatria, a feat only achieved once before in &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Enduring Bulwark.\nShortly after, the Helldivers would liberate Trandor, allowing the colonists at Gatria to finally breathe a sigh of relief as justice had finally been delivered upon those that had once brought them terror.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nGatria would remain loyal and free ever since its courageous defense during Operation Liberty Tide. However, the colonists of Gatria were not going to be able to fully live in peace as the Terminids soon recaptured Phact Bay and, later, recaptured Trandor. Then, some days later, the bugs captured Gar Haren, leaving Gatria besieged on all of its FTL Supply Lines. Yet, Gatria's colonists stood strong, digging trenchlines along the hillside and building lines of bunkers into the cliffs overlooking its seas. Then, on October 15th, the Terminids launched an assault of Gatria, once more from Trandor.\nAnd as with any lesson that hasn't quite yet been thoroughly taught, the Helldivers would turn up en masse to Gatria's defense as, once again, the attack on Gatria happened mere hours after &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; had been liberated and the 35,000 Helldivers there were now left free to take on any secondary objectives now that the target planets of the Major Order had been secured.\nIn just a little over 12 hours, Gatria had once more been defended against Terminid incursions, marking the 6th consecutive defensive victory on the planet as a whole, earning Gatria and its colonists a reputation of being among the most capable defenders that the Federation has to offer.\nInterim (October 22nd-October 28th).\nGatria would have rebuked the Terminids once more. Yet, despite their victory, the colonists of Gatria were still under siege from all available directions, as neither Gar Haren, Trandor nor Phact Bay had been liberated. As such, they hunkered down in their fortifications, awaiting an eventual attack. This attack would come just 7 days after the previous attacks, timed almost perfectly with an Automaton attack at &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt;. However, this attack also happened pretty much an hour before Estanu had been fully liberated once more, which would reflect shortly after the initial defensive operations concluded.\nAs Estanu's last Terminid hives were appropriately cleansed, many Super Destroyers turned up to Gatria's aid en masse, as not only did many Helldivers take a liking for the crimson planet, but Gatria also stood at an important crossroads in the Eastern galactic fringe, in addition to its admirable resistance in the face of Terminid expansion serving as an inspiration for some Helldivers among the corps.\nAfter some 17 hours of fighting, Gatria had once more been defended, though at the cost of losing Zefia to the robotic tide. Nevertheless, once more had the Gatrians defied all odds and defended their home planet from invasion despite being completely surrounded, making an enviable display of their fighting spirit and commitment to the cause of liberty.\nHowever, the Gatrians wouldn't get to spend much time in peace. After some quick reparations, the Gatrians would spend their time restablishing their settlements and, given how their siege still hadn't been relieved, digging more trenches and laying down miles of barbed wire in preparation for a future invasion. On Liberty Day, they would gather together to salute Super Earth and have what little cake and brewed freedom they had in stock, the candles being the only light in the shadow of their defensive bunkers as they celebrated another year of Managed Democracy.\nHowever, this solace would be as fragile as the peace that accompanied it and, on October 27th, the Terminids at Trandor would once more strike at Gatria, the bugs proving to be as relentless as they were foolish, as they had once more picked the wrong time to attack Gatria. Not only had the Helldivers been given a \"license to kill\" during Liberty Day, as no major orders would be issued, but both Gacrux and &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; had been lost a couple days prior, leaving Gatria as the only remaining foothold in the sector. \nAs such, the Helldivers were focused mostly on the liberation of Phact Bay. However, when the defense alerts came from both Gatria and &lt;a href=\"Yed%20Prior\"&gt;Yed Prior&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers opted to defend Gatria, as its loss would signify the complete loss of Jin Xi Sector.\nIn detriment of Yed Prior's defense against the Automatons, the main fleet of the Helldivers Corps turned up on Gatria to aid its defense one more time. By the early hours of October 28th, the Gatrians had defended their home once more against the fascist menace, marking yet another victory for the crimson planet against the Terminid scourge that besieged them on all sides.\nOperation Bughammer.\nGatria would remain unbothered by its neighbors ever since its final defense in October. Once the Helldivers turned the situation around and liberated Phact Bay a day later and then, on November 20th, liberated Gar Haren, Gatria would remain pretty much unbothered, its horrid siege finally being relieved and its citizens able to be resupplied at long last, after 2 long months of constant defiance against the fascist tide. However, true respite was still out of the Gatrians' reach, as Trandor still remained under the control of the Terminids.\nOn December 11th, nearby &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt; had been chosen to become the new site of a multi-complex factory hub for AM Defense, the new defense contractor for Super Earth. In response, the Terminids would launch an offensive in the Jin Xi and Sten Sectors in an attempt to capture Achernar, meaning that planets like Gatria, Phact Bay and Darius-II would become targets of interest for the bugs.\nOn December 12th, mere hours after the Helldivers successfully repelled a Terminid assault at Phact Bay, the Terminids attacked Gatria from Trandor, in a move that the Gatrians had already seen 6 consecutive times by this point. With the help of the Helldiver fleet, the Terminids were expected to be repelled well before the first day of the invasion even passed.\nBut then, the impossible occurred.\nReturn of the Illuminate.\nOut of nowhere, all SEAF forces, both active and in reserve duty, got ordered into LIBCON 1. Immediately, every single Helldiver in the galaxy would begin to deploy onto &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; in response to an emergency distress beacon that cited things that would have previously been thought unreal: The were attacking the planet.\nOn the face of such an ancient and dangerous foe, virtually all SEAF forces would mobilize towards Calypso, leaving essentially all other planets completely devoid of any Super Earth military presence. It would be this redeployment what would seemingly doom the defense of Gatria. Yet, the Gatrians were not going to give up their homes, which by now they had given many thousands of lives to defend.\nEven as most other frontline planets were essentially abandoned, a small garrison of Helldivers decided to stick by the side of the Gatrians, determined to at least evacuate as many of them as possible, in order to alleviate the loss of the planet so that it could later be recovered with more ease.\nGatria would fall on December 14th, 2184, after a long battle that, while a defeat for the Gatrians, it didn't mean devastation. Gatria had fallen, but its colonists stood firm and determined to one day reclaim their homes from the horrid hordes that had now pounced onto them.\nGatria fell before its wardens did."}

However, the Helldivers couldn't arrive in force due to other ongoing campaigns and, therefore, couldn't repel the raid, which would leave Gemma in ruins.\nHowever, not long after the nefarious raid on Gemma, the Illuminate would return once again in order to deny its colonists any respite. On December 27th, the Illuminate would send a second raid onto Gemma after their vicious raid at &lt;a href=\"Julheim\"&gt;Julheim&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking righteous payback for the first raid, and with orders to kill as many voteless and Harvesters as possible in order to aid research efforts, the Helldivers deployed in force onto Gemma."}

Mere hours after being righteously defeated at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, the Squids would make a second attempt at an offensive, attacking the underdefended Genesis with hopes of collapsing its defenses within 12 hours. However, they did not count with the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; and their righteous might who, having rebuked the Illuminate once, were already planning to repeat their feat a second time.\nHowever, the Illuminate would then send a second attack force towards nearby &lt;a href=\"Mog\"&gt;Mog&lt;/a&gt;, another valuable colony full of urban settlements. This development would force the Helldivers to divert towards its aid, as High Command updated orders and now demanded not just for Genesis Prime to be held, but for an additional 7 planets to be defended against the Squ'ith invaders.\nDespite the Helldiver's valuant efforts, they wouldn't be able to stop the Illuminate's sacking of Genesis Prime. Although they did manage to force the Illuminate to retreat, Genesis Prime was left in ruins, its urban colonies turned to smoldering rubble. But as with many things, in due time it shall all be rebuilt."}

A frozen, desolate tundra, this planet was home to a mothballed &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Super Earth Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; (SEAF) training facility, which was constructed in the initial days of the Second Galactic War. Following it's shutdown, it has been turned into a campground for the Democratic Youth Scouts. As of December 2184, it is the only planet in the entire Terminid Front to have a 100% campaign victory rate after 5 operations.\nTopography.\nHeeth is the sixth planet in a remote system of the same name. Anyone who looks at Heeth from above would be forgiven for thinking it a mostly-dead ball of ice, as it is a small, terrestrial backwater planet blanketed by intense blizzards.\nThanks to its distance from its native star, Heeth has a freezing arctic climate, with most of the surface being covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. Although the planet is habitable, it is also too cold for native intelligent life to develop, though the Terminids that infest the ice caves below the surface have been noted to be extremely resistant to colder temperatures.\nTemperatures across Heeth are almost always frigid, having been known to drop to -60\u00b0C after nightfall, and even lower during blizzards.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOperation Valiant Enclosure.\nHeeth, alongside with &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, was the first planet to feel the devastation that would be brought on by the Special Military Operation preceding the Second Galactic War. The Terminids contained within Heeth's E-710 farms suddenly broke out of control, forcing the SEAF to deploy the Helldivers for the first time in 100 years. As the Terminid outbreak slowly began to worsen, orders were made for the Helldivers to establish a defensive line at the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt; by first establishing a foothold in both Angel's Venture and Heeth.\nEven after being liberated, Heeth and Angel's Venture saw another Terminid siege before the month of February 2184 came to an end, which the Helldivers successfully repelled.\nDeployment of the Terminid Control System.\nShortly after Heeth and the barrier planets in the Umlaut Sector were firmly secured in Freedom's hands, Ministry of Science engineered the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;. This advanced network of towers was designed to deliver the newly-invented Termicide, a substance completely harmless to humans, but deadly to fascist, freedom-hating insectoids.\nWith the deployment of the TCS, Heeth and all systems up to the Barrier Planets saw a brief return to peace after long, grueling months of suffering. Between March and May 2184, the returning colonists of these planets happily worked their lands, settling planets and spreading the righteous rule of Managed Democracy just as Liberty intended.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nUnfortunately, during the first weeks of May 2184, the Termicide stopped working. Due to a novel process known as hormesis, the Terminids not only developed immunity to the Termicide, but also developed genetic mutations that allowed to reproduce up to an astonish 20 times faster than their usual rate. The Barrier Planets were overwhelmed, with &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; having been transformed into a Terminid Supercolony.\nImmediately after, chaos spread throughout all of the planets within the immediate vicinity of Meridia, with Heeth, Veld, and Angel's Venture being some of the few that, while still seeing regular onslaughts, still stood strong in the face of the Terminid scourge. The Galactic War on Tyranny had begun.\nSecond Galactic War.\nIn the wake of the Second Galactic War, a training facility was established by the SEAF on Heeth's frigid surface. To save on construction time (and cost), the training facility was carved out of a glacier and connected through artificial corridors linked together with structural supports, while natural caverns were expanded to suit the Federation's needs.\nAlthough the smallest of the four training facilities constructed, it is nonetheless still able to process millions of eager voluntary-conscripts, with the 72-hour SEAF basic training course being even more rigorous due to the harsh conditions of the planet's surface.\nPrior to Operation Enduring Peace.\nAs the war developed, the Terminids launched intermittent assaults on Heeth. The planet saw five separate assaults within the month of May, during Operations Metallic Harvest, Freedom's Calling, and Emancipator. Thankfully, the tactical genius and impeccable discipline of the Helldivers allowed it to stand strong against the bugs, even when other bases such as &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; had fallen.\nHeeth continued to suffer from Terminid offensives while Ministry of Science devised a solution to the Meridia problem through experiments performed on nearby &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nOn May 28th, 2184, Super Earth High Command decided that Meridia was too far gone to be saved, with its destruction being the only way to safeguard the Eastern Galactic Rim. While the SEAF established defensive lines at Fenrir III, Angel's Venture, and &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, Heeth withstood vicious attacks by the desperate Terminids, as they rushed towards &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to invade Moradesh before their experiments bore fruit.\nTheir vain attempts would prove futile, as during the morning of May 30th, the final remnants of the Terminid push towards Moradesh were crushed on Heeth. The Helldivers were soon able to deploy the newly-created &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt; on Meridia, destroying the Supercolony once and for all through its collapse into a black hole.\nOperation Starslayer.\nWith emergency recruitment levels swelling ranks to targeted numbers, training throughput requirements have been reducing. In light of this change, the surviving emergency SEAF Training Facilities on &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; were shut down and converted into recreational campgrounds for the Democratic Youth Scouts.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nFollowing its final defense in May and the closure of its SEAF Training Facilities, Heeth hasn't seen much action since. It would be attacked on November 5th, amidst a defensive operation aimed with protecting &lt;a href=\"Terrek\"&gt;Terrek&lt;/a&gt;, Cirrus and Angel's Venture. However, this attack was quickly repelled due to the Helldivers prioritizing Heeth due to its strategic location and its popularity given how rare its biome is on the Terminid front."}

The objective was to defend the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding systems from Automaton attacks. Despite constant assaults and being surrounded deep in enemy space, the Helldivers have made a valiant defense. The fierce Operation has been spread out over 5 planets.\n Prelude to the Campaign\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe initial Helldiver presence in the Ymir sector began a month earlier during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Rampart\"&gt;Operation Valiant Resistance.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; were liberated during this offensive, with inroads being made into retaking &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt; was never occupied by either side during the fighting, remaining under marginal Super Earth control despite being surrounded in Automaton space prior to the Operation. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, X-45 was fought over and suffered from radioactive destruction. It was transformed into a swampy forest overgrown with life over the century in between. A weapons lab from this war was discovered buried in rubble. With radiation at safe levels, Super Earth high command has begun efforts to recover the technology buried therein. The campaign has unlocked Tier 5 Super Destroyer upgrades and may provide plans for an Interplanetary battle station. With this incredible opportunity came danger however. It is suspected that a data breach created by &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;automaton&lt;/a&gt; hackers provided them knowledge of X-45's value. Super Earth acted swiftly in issuing the major order with the goal of defending X-45, ensuring its valuable knowledge fell solely into democratic hands.\nJuly 3rd\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Operation began on July 3rd. The first planets to see fighting on this day were &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; itself, &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;. Both planets received major boosts to their defenses from Helldivers responding to the call to arms. S.E.A.F regular forces were also at the height of their numerical strength at this time. These forces amassed on &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;. \nInitially, a minor automaton attack was launched against X-45 from &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;. This pitiful assault was repulsed before the end of the day thanks to the significant reinforcement from Super Earth.\nThe main automaton stronghold in the Ymir sector was &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa.&lt;/a&gt; A liberation campaign had been waged on Meissa since early June, but had since become bogged down. Super Earth reinforcements rapidly captured Meissa during this operation. By the end of July 3rd, the system was 45% liberated.\nFighting also broke out on &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;. The least amount of defending force was concentrated here, causing the fighting to become prolonged. Wezen would also be withheld from the Automaton forces.\nThe Helldivers won this first day of combat.\nJuly 4th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBattles on Meissa, X-45, and Wezen happened on this day.\nWezen was fully retaken early in the day. Peace would only last on this planet until later in the day of July 4th, however. Another battle began on July 4th. Helldiver attention had shifted elsewhere, resulting in a rapid loss of territory.\nFighting also continued throughout the night on Meissa. Later in the day, Meissa's liberation had reached as high as 85%. The campaign came to a quick pause as an Automaton force attacked X-45 once more from Meissa. \nThe attack against X-45 once again floundered. Meissa was nearly retaken, leaving the invader's access to supply tenuous. Fighting continued once again on all three systems into the night.\nThe advantage still seemed to be in the favor of the Helldivers.\nJuly 5th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn July 5th, the violence escalated. Fighting occured on every planet in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector.&lt;/a&gt;\nX-45 was held early in the day on July 5th. The automaton assault was heavily resisted, and their supply lines from Meissa were severed. The capture of Meissa early in the day of July 5th even opened up the path to &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay.&lt;/a&gt; Although this was a quiet day on X-45, the same cannot be said for the other planets in the sector.\nA relentless assault began on &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay.&lt;/a&gt; The automatons rapidly took ground here. Helldiver forces fought hard to stifle their progress\nOn Wasat and Wezen, things looked even more grim. Unchecked progress was made late into the day. Wezen had been nearly lost by the end of July 5th. Surprisingly, The attack against Wasat was abandoned by the enemy. \nThis abandonment seems to be a tactical retreat, designed to distract Helldiver forces. This move strengthened automaton assaults against Vega Bay and a new attack on Meissa. The fighting grew even more desperate on Vega Bay, as it seemed like the planet would be lost. The apparent falls of Vega Bay and Wezen made the supply situation very arduous for Helldiver forces. With the only apparent source of supplies coming from X-45, The loss of external support risked the possibility of attrition. \nThe Automatons made significant gains on this day. Wezen and Vega Bay were almost entirely lost. Heavy fighting continued on Meissa through the night. \nJuly 6th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn July 6th, Disaster struck on far away &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass.&lt;/a&gt;\nS.E.A.F reinforcements had amassed here to assist in the Operation. However, Helldiver reinforcements had not been able to prevent the fall of this planet during the operation. With most forces locked in combat in the Ymir sector or scattered across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front,&lt;/a&gt; little help could be spared to defend the planet. Furthermore, the S.E.A.F bases in the east were converted into campgrounds due to the temporary saturation of Super Earth's manpower needs.\nBy this day, a cache of &lt;a href=\"MLS-4X%20Commando\"&gt;MLS-4X Commando rocket launchers&lt;/a&gt; had been recovered, but more time was needed to find the plans for the battle station. \nWezen was lost on this day. The last ~300 Helldivers, desperately trying to hold the supply lines open were forced to retreat with the loss of Vega Bay. Minor fighting does continue on Vega Bay. On Meissa, the hard fought defense was barely won, leaving the planet in democratic hands. Sporadic fighting continued on this day, resulting in little more than stalemate.\nJuly 7th-9th\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLarger battles picked up once more the next day. The scale of the operation shrunk down to Vega Bay, Wasat, and X-45.\nA minor liberation campaign still continued on Vega Bay. This was one direction that the Automaton assault against X-45 could come from.\nA final assault against Wasat was made. It would become apparent that this was another desperate ruse, however. \nHeavy yet inconsequential fighting continued on Wasat and Vega bay until the 8th. Early in the day of July 8th, A final offensive was opened against X-45. Wasat was defended successfully by the middle of July 8th, and a few thousand Helldivers continued to put a thorn in the enemy's side on Vega Bay.\nThe attack against X-45 was launched from Vega Bay. Helldiver forces retained a significant edge over the enemy during this attack. By the middle of July 8th, Wasat was retaken. With nearly all the forces in the Ymir sector focused on retaking X-45, the planet fell late into the night of July 8th. After X-45 was saved, ~12,000 of the remaining Helldivers rotated to Vega Bay. By July 9th, the operation came to a successful conclusion.\nOutcome / Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Operation was a tactical victory for Super Earth. X-45 and Wasat were successfully defended from the automatons. Meissa was also captured during this operation. More significantly, new technologies were reclaimed. The new MLS-4X Commando Rocket Launchers, new tier 5 ship upgrades, and the plans for an interplanetary battle station were recovered. \nThe automatons did gain a major strategic victory also. They conquered Wezen and Vega Bay. Concerningly, this leaves the free systems of the Ymir Sector very isolated from Super Earth space. Their capture of Aesir Pass also significantly reduced the scale S.E.A.F forces, and temporarily prevented further enlistment.\nAccurate casualty reports were not collected for this operation. On X-45, it is known that ~5,500,000 Helldivers fell. ~240,000,000 Automatons also lie in the planet's mud. The net casualty numbers are much greater than this due to the fighting on other planets, which are unknown. A massive amount of S.E.A.F forces also perished due to the adjacent fighting on &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass.&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Hardcase.\n[Placeholder Information]\nKill one hundred million Terminids to aid in classified scientific research.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Andromeda.\nOperation Andromeda is a 6-Day long offensive operation lasting from July 11th-July 17th to liberate &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector.&lt;/a&gt; The objective was to retake all 4 planets by the end of the operation. This would have the strategic outcome of dividing Automaton territory in half, &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;isolating their holdings&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt; and the lower &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; sectors.\nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThere were two important events that preceded Operation Andromeda. The first was &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Starslayer\"&gt;Operation Starslayer.&lt;/a&gt; Super Earth retook &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a pathway towards attacking &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay.&lt;/a&gt; The strategic &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass System&lt;/a&gt; was also lost during this operation, making it a prime target of recapture. The successful defense of the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir sector&lt;/a&gt; in early July ensured that it could be linked up with the rest of democratic space. The operation also strengthened Helldiver forces, providing new upgrades and weaponry from &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45's&lt;/a&gt; weapon cache.\nSecondly was the Terminid Research Initiative. This was a xenocidal operation to kill 100,000,000 terminids for research purposes. This operation kept the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; under control during early July. \nJuly 11th 2184\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nJuly 11th was the first day of the Operation. Initial progress was slow, as Helldiver forces had to rotate from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;. The day one fighting occurred on Aesir Pass and Matar bay. Helldiver forces were split between these two systems. Both Aesir Pass and Matar bay where were the final Automaton supply lines were, splitting Helldiver attention between them. By the end of July 11th, only minimal progress had been made.\nThroughout the operation, it had become apparent that the offensive's speed was hampered by the division of Helldiver attention. \nJuly 12th 2184\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy the second day of the operation, greater progress had been made. The force attacking Aesir Pass had swelled to ~25,000 by midday. Halfway liberation progress was reached a few hours later. The offensive on Matar Bay was still going poorly. A force of ~7,000 had failed to liberate more than 0.6% of the planet by midday. By the end of the night, ~80% of Aesir Pass and ~5% of Matar Bay were captured. By the latter part of July 12th, &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20500kg%20Bomb\"&gt;500 KG Bombs&lt;/a&gt; would be offered to help the offensive. Aesir Pass and Matar Bay are both foggy, gloomy worlds. Eagle pilots worked hard around the clock to bring the piercing light of liberty from their bomber ships. \nMany Helldivers were left sore and bruised, with ringing ears and bloodshot eyes. Still, about half of the attacking force on both planets remained overnight to continue the campaign. The fierce yet futile resistance offered by the automatons is most similar to the campaigns in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin sector&lt;/a&gt; in early April. With the strategic value of Aesir Pass and Matar Bay, the cancerous automatons know that this is a fight for their very survival; a fight that they will not win.\nJuly 13th 2184\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe remaining 20% liberation progress was completed by the early morning of July 13th, leaving Aesir Pass free. The capture of Aesir Pass also opened the way to &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, although fighting here is minimal and not part of the major order.\nNow the capture of Matar Bay was all the Helldivers needed to break the Automaton supply lines. The Helldiver force on Matar Bay grew by 6x, with ~19,000 fighters on the planet surface by the morning of the 13th. Progress had reached 15% by the morning.\nWith the capture of Aesir Pass, the third planet designated as an operation target was reached. ~8,000 Helldivers pushed on from Aesir Pass to the icy world of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. No progress had been made by morning. A significant amount of Helldiver attention during this operation has been occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;. On the morning of July 13th, The Terminids made incursions into recently liberated &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;. Most Helldivers on the Eastern Front are not responding to this threat, focusing on the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The poor allocation of Super Earth manpower would luckily prove to not affect the operation. Steady progress continued on Matar Bay into the night, with over half of the planet liberated by the end of July 13th. ~15,000 Helldivers would continue to fight into the later hours. No significant progress had been made on Marfark still. The rapid conquest of Matar Bay is extremely dangerous to the Automaton's territorial integrity. &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;11 Automaton systems would be cut off&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan's&lt;/a&gt; supply, including the whole of the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuly 14th 2184\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSteady progress continued through the morning of July 14th. Matar was 95% captured by mid day, and expected to fall very soon afterward. No progress had been made on Marfark still. A little after the middle of the day, Matar Bay was captured. The capture of Matar Bay completed &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;the maneuver to cut off the Automaton forces&lt;/a&gt;. According to S.E.A.F intelligence, this caused a decrease in automaton resistance due to them calculating the inevitable victory of Super Earth. \nThe bulk of Helldiver forces rotated to Marfark, reaching &gt;20,000. ~10,000 also began the assault on &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; today. Martale had been occupied for over 3 months by this point. The progress on retaking the planet began slow due to the primary focus on Marfark. Towards the end of the day, Marfark reached over 17% liberation with ~19,000 Helldivers on the planet. \nJuly 15th 2184 \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nProgress continued slow and steady on Marfark through the morning. By mid day, over half of the planet was liberated. Still, no progress had been made on Martale. For some reason, the invasion force of Marfark did not recover to it's pre-night levels. At midday, it was barely ~21,000, falling to ~17,000 later that evening. Progress reached 66% later in the day of the 15th. The Helldiver's offensive momentum appeared to be slumping now, with reduced strength on other fronts too.\nBy the end of July 15th, the Helldiver force on Marfark had dropped to less than 10,000. Progress reached 91.5%.\nJuly 16th 2184\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe few remaining Helldivers managed to make the last push to liberate Marfark in the early morning of July 16th, leaving 32 hours and ~9,000 fighters to retake Martale. Casualties have been fairly low despite the ferocity of the combat. The capture of Marfark saw a beginning in uptick on the liberation progress for Martale. After the battles through the ice and ash, the campaign would come to a conclusion on Martale's beautiful fields. By morning, Helldiver strength had rejuvenated back to ~23,000. The weakening strength of the automatons combined with the lack of division among forces in the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;andromeda sector&lt;/a&gt; is giving the Helldivers the last bit of strength they need to take Martale. By this point, Martale was 30% liberated. Well after noon was when &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; reached over 50% liberation. The planet was on schedule to be liberated by the morning of the 17th. The liberation percentage at the end of the day was ~83%\nJuly 17th 2814 \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Helldivers in the very early morning of the 17th was around ~11,000 strong. By the mid-morning they had finally liberated Martale from the Automatons. Those who perished in the Martale Gambit of April that achieved 94% liberation had been avenged, finally freeing this planet, and successfully completing Operation Andromeda with under 8 hours left.\nWith the major operation completed, about ~7,000 Helldivers continued the offensive onto &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. Many others left for the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutcome/Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAll four planets, &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; were liberated. The major order was a success for the Helldivers. The Major order has left automaton forces in the whole &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon sector&lt;/a&gt; cut off, as well as some planets in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; sectors. These planets have no access to supplies from Cyberstan, the Automaton capital, and will be easier to reconquer. \n16.5 Million Helldivers perished during the offensive. They took 584,847,000 Automatons to the grave with them. \nAesir Pass: 4,201,000 Helldivers, 141,889,000 Automatons\u00a0 (34 Automatons for every 1 Helldiver)\nMarfark: 3,823,000 Helldivers, 145,455,000 Automatons (38 Automatons for every 1 Helldiver)\nMatar Bay: 4,511,000 Helldivers, 160,182,000 Automatons (36 Automatons for every 1 Helldiver)\nMartale: 4,022,000 Helldivers, 137,321,000 Automatons (34 Automatons for every 1 Helldiver)\nScan report shows the required planets liberated from the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Righteous Expunge.\nOperation Righteous Expunge is a 3-day long offensive operation in the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt; during the Second Galactic War. The objective was to liberate &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt;. This offensive takes advantage of the weak state of &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Automaton planets cut off&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;, which won't be able to resist a determined Helldiver attack.\nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith the success of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Andromeda\"&gt;Operation Andromeda&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers had retaked ground as far into Automaton space as &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;. They also left the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;lower half of Automaton Space cut off&lt;/a&gt; from reinforcements from Cyberstan. For the previous few days, Automaton resistance became more desperate yet ineffective. With this heightened ability to conquer Automaton planets, the Helldivers made quick progress into the lower &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; despite waning numbers. In the days of July 17th-July 18th between Operation Andromeda and Operation Righteous Expunge, significant progress was made in taking &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuly 18th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWhen the Major Order was issued in the morning of the 18th, most of the Helldivers on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; were already on Charon Prime, the first objective of the offensive. A little under half of the planet was already liberated. The offensive force swelled to over 20,000 within a few hours, bolstering progress. By noon of July 18th, liberation had reached 68%. On Charbal-VII, a smaller offensive of ~1,000 Helldivers began on this day too. Due to the weak state of the Automaton army, even this small force is making progress. By noon, they had nearly reached 3% liberation.\nOn Charon Prime, the planet reached 93% liberation in the early evening of the 18th. Part of the Helldiver force rotated to Matar Bay to defend against an Automaton attempt to break through the barrier planets. The efforts on Charball VII only rendered another 4% of liberation. Charon Prime would fall in the late evening of this day. The offensive priority would then shift to Charbal VII as well as to defend Matar Bay. Matar Bay took priority, with Charbal VII only swelling to ~7,000 attackers and making minimal progress. As nightfall arrived, the forces on both planets was reduced by a third, stalling progress.\nDefense of Matar Bay (July 18th-19th)\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShortly into the afternoon of the 18th, a priority alert was sounded throughout every Super Destroyer in the galaxy. &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the most strategically important of the barrier worlds, was under attack. ~5,000 Helldivers rotated to defend the system while maintaining pressure on Charon Prime. The assault was very strong and initially was going badly. After the fall of Charon Prime in the evening of July 18th, the defense force swelled to 12,000. The defense progress picked up, but still was falling short by nightfall, when the force was reduced to ~8,500 Helldivers. Late into the morning of the 19th, Helldivers reclaimed the initiative in defending the system. Shortly after the noon of the 19th, the defense was won. \nJuly 19th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSlow progress continued on Charbal-VII in the very early morning of the 19th. Approximately 11% was reached well after midnight. The defensive action on Matar Bay also swung back into Helldiver favor at this time. During the morning, &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal VII&lt;/a&gt; reached approximately 20% liberation. Shortly before this, the offensive on &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; began from the supply line on Martale. Small forces of ~2,000 to ~4,000 made significant early progress. The force on Charball VII Swelled to ~6,000, and reached 22% liberation shortly after noon. Disappointingly, the afternoon and evening of the 19th saw less than half of Helldiver forces dedicated to the major order. However, this day also was a blessing in terms of collective strategic thinking due to the prioritization of Matar Bay. By the end of the day, half of Charball-VII was liberated. Almost a fourth of Choepessa IV was liberated, and Matar Bay was fully secure.\nJuly 20th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBrave Helldivers fought through the early morning of July 20th. Progress was slow but steady. The offensive was disrupted shortly after midnight by another Automaton assault. The &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass system&lt;/a&gt;, a critical barrier planet, was attacked. &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Terminid front&lt;/a&gt; also came under assault, occupying Helldiver attention. A large amount of Helldiver forces continue to battle in the east in spite of the major order. Despite the distractions, Charbal-VII reached over 75% liberation later in the morning of the 20th. Choepessa IV reached 37% at this same time. Steady progress continued through the afternoon, with &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; being liberated late in the evening of this day. Some of these forces proceeded to Choepessa IV, which was nearly at 50% liberation by this time.\nDefense of Aesir Pass (July 20th-21st)\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShortly after midnight, the cowardly Automatons struck &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; when few Helldivers were mobilized to resist their assault. A response group of ~1,000 immediately deployed for battle to resist the Automaton attack. For the first hour of the defense, the Helldivers checked the Automaton assault. Later in the morning of the 20th, this defensive force was outnumbered and ineffective in stopping the enemy, which made unchecked gains on Aesir Pass. By the end of July 20th, it was clear that Aesir Pass would be lost. However, this will not sever Super Earth's supply line to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front.&lt;/a&gt; The supply lines to the now liberated &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; come from &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt;.\nJuly 21st \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFighting on Aesir Pass would end shortly after Midnight of the 21st, leaving the planet occupied by Automatons.\nThe situation on Choepessa IV was very concerning. The planet had reached 67% liberation. With less than 8 hours to go until the end of the offensive, and the size of the Helldiver force decreasing, the chance to capture the system in time is slim. At midnight, the Helldivers were projected to capture the system with only an hour to spare. Later in the early morning of the 21st, it looked like defeat was inevitable. Helldiver forces were making very little progress. However, with their numbers swelling as night gave way to morning, the Helldiver's strength and resolve was boosted. With mere minutes to spare, &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; was liberated, securing victory for &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth.&lt;/a&gt; Combat came to an end on the morning of the 21st. Exhausted Helldivers with armor soaked in blood and oil were able to rest easy knowing that Managed Democracy had been well served that day.\nOutcome / Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAll designated planets were secured. The &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; was fully liberated by the end of the Operation, along with 24% of the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this desperately fought for Super Earth victory, &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; was lost. Furthermore, the operation showed both good and bad sides to Helldiver strategic thinking. While Helldivers were able to rally a defense of Matar Bay to support the major order, they failed to do the same on Aesir Pass, and only barely completed the major order. More Helldivers from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; are needed to contain the Automaton menace.\n5,644,000 Helldivers perished on the 3 planets relating to the Major Order. They defeated 204,856,000 Automatons in this conquest. If we include other strategic defense missions, the net casualty count rises to 6,729,000 Helldivers and 253,302,000 Automatons\nCharon Prime After: 987,000* Helldivers, 34,259,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 35 Automatons)\nChoepessa IV After: 2,052,000 Helldivers, 84,129,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 41 Automatons)\nCharbal-VII After: 2,605,000 Helldivers, 86,468,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 33 Automatons)\nMatar Bay After: 756,000 Helldivers, 35,406,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 47 Automatons)\nAesir Pass After: 329,000 Helldivers, 13,040,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 40 Automatons)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nOperation Glorious Xenocide is a 5 Day long xenocide operation on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. The objective was to kill 1,000,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; for research purposes. This offensive is taking place across the whole Eastern Front from July 22nd to July 27th, although the operation came to an end early on July 26th\nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe month of July was a disorganized time on the Eastern Front. With most of the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;Major Orders&lt;/a&gt; being directed at the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt;, there was little organization to the fighting in the east, which spread across multiple planets. A day before Operation Glorious Xenocide, the Helldivers rallied to defend an attack on &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;. After the desperate fighting during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Righteous%20Expunge\"&gt;Operation Righteous Expunge&lt;/a&gt;, Helldivers were still able to rally and defeat the terminid menace. \nJuly 22nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe operation had a strong start on the morning of July 22nd. over 3 million Terminids were killed in the first hour. Most fighting in these early hours occured on &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, which had a large force of ~15,000 Helldivers on it's surface in a drawn out liberation campaign. 8% progress had been reached 8 hours into the operation.\nJuly 23rd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAcamar IV was liberated shortly after midnight. At this time, 17.8% of the total required amount of Terminids had been slain. Because this operation prioritized sheer death counts, and few Helldivers were available at this hour, the only planet with significant liberation effort at this time was &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the morning of the 23rd, bad code from a cybersecurity software update caused a data outage to occur, leaving the percentage counter stuck at 23.8% for a time. Luckily, Super Earth command suggested the brilliant idea of just rebooting the ship's systems 15 times until they worked again, resolving the issue. Across the galaxy, enemy resistance increased. Helldiver forces across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; were in large part disorganized still. Gacrux had reached 44.6% in liberation by the end of July 23rd. Almost 40% of the required terminids were killed by this point too\nDuring July 23rd, There was slightly increased player activity due to the announcement of the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, which was coming on August 6th. A &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;quasar cannon&lt;/a&gt; was also allotted to Helldivers on this day.\nJuly 24th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe benefits of Quasar cannons and increased player limits continued into the early morning of July 24th. Shortly after the noon of the 24th, progress exceeded 50%. Also around this time, &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; was attacked. The allotment of a quasar cannon was replaced with an &lt;a href=\"RL-77%20Airburst%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Airburst Rocket Launcher.&lt;/a&gt; The defense of Fenrir III was in the terminid favor until later in the afternoon. From then on, this planet would be the focal point of Helldiver assault during the operation. The planet's defense progress would fall back into favor. The recently liberated &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa&lt;/a&gt; system came under assault today and is expected to fall. The total operation progress reached just shy of 2/3 completion by midnight\nJuly 25th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nGacrux reached 80% liberation late on the night of the 25th. Helldivers were warned that the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; would be regrouping soon. Planets like &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa&lt;/a&gt; have been at risk due to the Helldiver's occupation in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the day, &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; was fully liberated. Helldivers were allotted &lt;a href=\"Mines%23Incendiary_Mines\"&gt;Incendiary Mines&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the full liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi sector&lt;/a&gt;. From here on, the war shifted to the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco Sector,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; in particular. The mines proved to be especially useful yet dangerous during this operation. Although they could easily stop hordes of bugs, they were responsible for high rates of (alleged) friendly fire accidents. By midnight of the 25th, The operation percentage had reached 88.2%. Estanu was 13% liberated, with insignificant progress on all other planets.\nJuly 26th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe final steps to victory would be carried out on this day. Helldivers lost access to the Incendiary Mines, but still made good strides in culling the Terminid population. At noon, 98% objective progress was reached. Estanu, the focal point of this day's fighting, had reached 39% liberation. Less than an hour later, the operation was complete, finishing a whole day early. \nOutcome/Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe 1,000,000,000 required Terminids were killed ahead of schedule. By the end of the operation, the whole &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi sectors&lt;/a&gt; were liberated. The operation gave Helldivers a much needed break from combat in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;, although some planets were lost during the operation's course. \n13,485,000 Helldivers perished, taking 1,000,000,000 Terminids with them. This ratio amounts to 1 Helldiver for every 74 Terminids.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nOperation Liberty Crush was a 6 day long offensive operation lasting from July 27th, 2184, to August 2nd, 2184. It took place in the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. The objective was to capture &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the operation, clearing out most of the Automaton forces in this area. \nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing previous operations in Early and mid July, the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;lower part of Automaton space&lt;/a&gt; had been cut off from resupply from &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;. The defense of these planets became extremely weak. For example, a force of just 1,000 to 500 Helldivers were able to capture 10% of Vandalon IV during this time of Super Earth dominance on the Western Front. Super Earth command did warn days prior to Operation Liberty Crush of a resurgence of Automaton forces. This would come in the form of Orbital Cannons. These battle implements resulted in a terrible loss to shuttle pilots, resulting in 45 seconds being lost on every extraction until two planets were liberated within 12 hours of each other. \nJuly 27th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe operation began on the morning of the 27th. The planet seeing the heaviest fighting was Choepessa. This system was already a target of Helldivers in the West prior to the major order. It's capture would open the way to Ustotu and Varylia 5, expediting the operation's progress and redeeming the Helldiver failure to defend &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; in the past week. A few hours after the order began, Choepessa was already exceeding 85% liberation. A similar situation was playing out on &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, which was at 28% liberation. 28,000 Helldivers participated in the major order at it's launching. Large amounts of forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; were not joining the attack, despite the Western Front's Helldivers always assisting in &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; operations.\nIn the early evening, Choepessa IV fell. This caused the longer extraction times to return to normal for 12 hours. The fall of Choepessa opened up the way to Ustotu and Varylia 5. Immediately after the fall of Choepessa, the Helldivers were disorganized and scattered throughout the planets of the Western Front. Their most significant presence was on Wasat, ~10,000 Helldivers, and on Varylia 5, ~6,000 Helldivers. Wasat already had liberation percentage, but little progress was made on Varylia. Little progress was made for the rest of the day, with the primary focus being on Wasat.\n July 28th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nLong extraction times returned on the morning of the 28th. ~6% liberation was achieved on Varylia 5 and Vega Bay. Wasat remained the main focus, although not by much. Wasat would reach 90% by the end of this day, with no other major progress occuring on the other planets. The fall of Wasat would cause the morning of the 29th to see no extraction time increases. Progress past this point will be hampered by the disunity and small size of the Helldiver force on the Western Front. \nJuly 29th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAfter the fall of Wasat, the bulk of Helldiver forces in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; shifted to Vega Bay. They would enjoy normal extraction times until shortly after noon. Unfortunately, the offensive was weak on the 29th, although more organized than on the previous day. Vega Bay continued to see the greatest focus, and reached over 80% by the end of the night. Varylia 5 was just short of 20%, and progress was minimal on all other planets. With the temporary decrease in Helldiver strength, there are fears that the Matar Bay Encirclement won't be closed in time for the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom.&lt;/a&gt;\nJuly 30th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nEarly in the morning of the 30th, when Vega Bay had nearly reached liberation, &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was attacked. Meager resistance was offered due to the hour of this treacherous offensive. If the Automatons capture both X-45 and &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;encirclement&lt;/a&gt; will be broken. Luckily, the swift capture of Vega Bay later that morning stopped that opportunity. The automatons cowardly ceased their attempt to take X-45, leaving the planet in democratic hands. The capture of Vega Bay caused most Helldiver forces to shift to Varylia 5. They made progress throughout the day, overcoming grueling extraction times of over four minutes, the longest ever seen in the Second Galactic War. By the end of the day, 2/3 of Varylia 5 was liberated. Insignificant progress was made on Ustotu and Wezen. \nJuly 31st\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nVarylia 5 continued to be liberated throughout the early morning of July 31st. It would be liberated several hours after midnight. The primary focus shifted to Ustotu, which had reached 8% by noon. The focus remained there, with nearly no progress on other planets the whole day. Fierce desert fighting proved to be challenging, for the planet was just shy of half liberated by midnight. This day proved to be alarming, leaving very little time to reclaim Ustotu and Wezen.\n August 1st \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe situation remained the same as on the prior day. By noon, Ustotu was almost at ~80% liberation. Wezen had no significant progress. By noon. only 22 hours remained to retake both planets. On the evening of the 1st, Ustotu was freed at last. A force of ~25,000 Helldivers immediately rotated to Wezen to finish the objective. Their success is tenuous but nevertheless possible. The liberation of Ustotu enabled shorter extraction times for the duration of the end of the operation. Wezen was at 15% liberation by midnight.\n August 2nd\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOnly ~10 hours would fall under August 2nd. The Helldivers had to complete 85% liberation during their weakest hours of the day. On the blinding sun scorched plains of Wezen, ~10,000 Helldivers bravely fought during the uncertain night. Shortly before afternoon, the time left on the major order ran out. Wezen had reached 55.1% liberation, but was not captured in time. The Helldivers had lost, yet Wezen would continue to be contested, and would ultimately be liberated days later on the 5th.\nAftermath / Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFour of the five planets were liberated, along with &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was also defended. Although the Automatons still hold &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; were liberated. The &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt; has been greatly reduced in size, although 3 planets still remain, Wezen being among them.\n15,269,000 Helldivers died during the offensive. This increases to 15,841,000 when non-official systems are included. 541,601,000 Automatons were slain during the offensive, with this number rising to 564,116,000 when including non official systems.\nWasat: 2,638,000 Helldivers, 87,650,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 33 Automatons)\nWezen: 2,626,000 Helldivers, 82,592,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 31 Automatons) Extremely poor KD ratio\nUstotu: 3,722,000 Helldivers, 135,277,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 36 Automatons) \nVega Bay: 2,752,000 Helldivers, 105,997,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 39 Automatons)\nVarylia 5: 3,531,000 Helldivers, 130,085,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 37 Automatons)\nChoepessa: 545,000 Helldivers, 21,345,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 39 Automatons) \nX-45: 27,420 Helldivers, 1,170,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 43 Automatons) Extremely high KD Ratio\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAugust 2024\nOperation Vengeful Cleansing.\nOperation Vengeful Cleansing is a 3 1/2 day long Xenocide operation on both the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western fronts&lt;/a&gt; during the 2nd Galactic War. The objective was to kill 1,500,000,000 Terminids and Automatons for research purposes. The offensive is taking place across the entire galaxy.\nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn the morning of August 2nd, Helldivers were desperately trying to liberate &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;. They had almost entirely freed the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;, but had scarcely been prevented from achieving victory. In the east during this whole time, the fighting was not organized, despite a futile rally to take &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;. The state of Helldiver forces in July caused Super Earth command to question if allotment of new mine technology was necessary. The attack was ordered to inflict sheer destructive damage upon the enemy.\n August 2nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSome Helldivers continued their attack on &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of this operation. Many departed for the Eastern Front to take advantage of the allotted incendiary mines, which were more effective on Terminids. Helldivers were scattered across the galaxy, with the heaviest fighting taking place in the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco sector&lt;/a&gt;. This remained the case throughout the day. Some Helldivers persisted in the assault on Wezen, capturing 1/5 of the planet and bringing it up to 73% liberation. 10.5% of the required amount of enemies killed was reached by midnight.\nAugust 3rd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShortly after midnight, &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; came under attack. As night changed into day, Helldiver were able to comfortably resist the Terminid attack without sacrificing their priorities on &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;. By noon, both of these planets had gained another ~10% in liberation. It was also clear by then that Gacrux would be held. Fighting continued all day, not bearing enough of a result. By midnight, roughly 30% of the objective was reached. Estanu was at 64% liberation, Wezen was at 86%, Gacrux was liberated, and all other systems had insignificant liberation progress.\nAugust 4th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith reduced Helldiver activity on the night of the 4th, liberation progress on Wezen ground to a halt. Progress would be made on Estanu. After a month of continuous fighting on the desolate planet, the liberation of Estanu would come at last.\nOn the previous operation, extraction times were increased to upwards of 4 minutes due to the enemy Orbital Cannons. On this day, a surprising change in the aerial landscape occured. Now Super Earth rules the alien skies, reducing extraction times to as little as 30 seconds on this day. Objective progress reached ~37% by noon. Estanu and Wezen were both almost liberated by this point. Shortly after noon today, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; was attacked. 7,000 Helldivers sprung to the defense of the planet. By the evening of the 4th, it was clear Marfark would be held though. Around the later part of the day, Estanu was liberated at last. Wezen was shortly behind at 98%.\nAugust 5th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShortly after midnight, Wezen was liberated. This completed the strategic aim of &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Liberty%20Crush\"&gt;Operation Liberty Crush&lt;/a&gt;, and left the whole Ymir sector in democratic hands. In spite of the Helldiver's efforts on the ground, the wider aim of the operation was almost certainly in vain. With only a day left, only 47% progress was achieved. The soon-to-be likely defeat will ensure Helldivers are given Anti-Tank mine technology. Not long after midnight, Marfark was also freed. This had almost entirely reduced the Automaton conquests to the size it was at in April. Today, Helldivers were allotted the Anti-Personnel Minefield. \nFollowing the liberation of Estanu the previous night, Helldiver forces on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; rotated to nearby Crimsica. The liberation of &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; was well underway. By shortly after noon, Helldivers had liberated half of the planet. Objective progress was ~64% by the end of August 5th. Crimsica was at ~68%, and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;, the current focus in the Western Front, was at 8% by the end of the day.\nAugust 6th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAlthough defeat was assured by the start of this day, a final burst of action came from the increase in Helldiver strength caused by the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom.&lt;/a&gt; Shortly after the end of the Major Order, Crimsica would nearly be liberated, but the campaign fell just short of victory due to the massive battle unfolding. With no time to lose, Helldivers becan the next xenocidal offensive on &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;.\n Outcome/Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDespite the defeat, Super Earth had a great net-outcome. Estanu and Wezen were liberated during the course of the operation. Gacrux and X-45 were defended from enemy attack. Helldivers also received Anti-Tank mines. With the new Escalation of Freedom, the strength of the Helldivers swelled overnight, giving them the power to redeem their defeat in the next major order.\n18,669,000 Helldivers were killed during the operation\n~700,000,000 Automatons and Terminids were defeated.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation.\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation is a 5-day mixed operation on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; during the Second Galactic War. The objective was to kill 500,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;, And to liberate &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock.&lt;/a&gt; It is the first Major Order to take place after the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. \nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nRight before this operation, a xenocidal operation known as &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Vengeful%20Cleansing\"&gt;Operation Vengeful Cleansing&lt;/a&gt; was underway. Although this wasn't successful, it led to Helldiver victories across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting shifted to the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff Sector&lt;/a&gt; as a result of likely embellished reports by the Super Earth Armed Forces, deeming the situation severe enough to warrant mass Helldiver intervention. The scale of Helldiver forces was rapidly increasing due to the Escalation of Freedom, meaning that the response would be swift and unforgiving.\nAugust 6th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe rejuvenated Helldiver force, fresh from their many prior victories, flooded the skies of Socorro III with Super Destroyers. 45,000 Helldivers arrived here initially. Another 6,000 began the liberation campaign on Esker. 3% progress was achieved in just the first 2 hours of the operation. What the Helldivers found on Socorro III was true hell.\nEven with the massive increase to Helldiver strength over the course of the day, which turned the tide of the defense of Socorro III, the fighting was of an intensity not seen since the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Meridia%23Destruction_of_Meridia\"&gt;Battle of Meridia.&lt;/a&gt; The planet transformed from an ethereal pink savannah into a swampy, infested hellhole of vile Terminid destruction. The progress on Crimsica began to backslide during this time, falling to 98.3%. The strength of the Helldivers continued to grow, surpassing 56,000 by noon. The size of the defense force stabilized at 49,000 a few hours after noon. By then, the defense progress was beginning to shift in the favor of the Helldivers. The strength of the Helldiver force began to decrease as night approached. Towards the end of the day, Crimsica was in a rapid backslide of progress, down to 91% liberation. Vandalon IV was still secure at 11%. No progress was made on Esker or Bore Rock. The Helldivers had a tenuous lead in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAugust 7th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe major center of fighting remained on Socorro III today. Early in the morning of the 7th, &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt; was attacked. Only ~4,000 Helldivers sprung to her aid, as most continued the fighting on the objective planets. 2 hours before noon, Socorro III reached 60% on the kill progress, with 300,000,000 terminids killed in harsh swamp combat. By noon, the strength of the force on Socorro III decreased to &lt;40,000. Also at this time, Super Earth officials acknowledged the special danger posed by the new Terminid variants faced by Helldivers. A cloud of interstellar spores, which were forming nearby, were to blame. \nBy the end of the day, no progress had been made in any system other than Socorro III. The objective of 500,000,000 dead bugs was 90% of the way, and it was likely that the battle for Socorro III would wrap up in the early morning of August 8th.\nAugust 8th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Hellish First Battle of Socorro III ended on this day, with the Helldivers defending against the Terminid onslaught successfully. It is likely further fighting will occur, as only 93.2% of required Terminids were killed. According to Super Earth command, this massive battle had weakened the Terminid colonies so much, that they would be extremely weak for the coming days. ~30,000 Helldivers attacked Esker, and another 11,000 attacked Erson Sands. Progress was rapidly made on both planets. The Freedom's Flame warbond was released on this day, providing Helldiver forces with more equipment to combat the enemy with.\nEsker was already halfway liberated shortly after noon on the 8th. Concerningly, the spore cloud near Socorro III continued to expand. By midnight of the 8th, a miracle had clearly occurred on Esker. This planet was already at 95% liberation, despite the offensive only being waged for under 24 hours. Helldiver forces had a comfortable 32 Hours left to conquer Bore Rock and defend the inevitable counterattack on Socorro. With their numbers still inflated from the Escalation of Freedom, and the Terminids is a weakened state, this task was ever so close to their grasp.\nAugust 9th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nEsker was liberated about an hour after midnight. As predicted, a 24 hour defense mission began on Socorro III minutes later. Helldivers were split between Socorro III and Bore Rock, the next planet to liberate. Most chose Bore Rock, as the 100% kill progress was easily met on Socorro, with ~30,000 joining the attack on Bore Rock by noon. They accomplished ~25% liberation by that time. On Socorro, the defense was almost fully won by noon. ~15,000 defended the system, which was under little threat by this point. \nOn Erson Sands, all liberation progress had been lost since the failed defense. Good news on Bore Rock came by midnight. 82% of the planet was liberated by day's end. The final hours of the operation would see certain victory.\nAugust 10th / Aftermath \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n~29,000 Helldivers were present on &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt; at midnight. These Helldivers captured the planet in half the time, securing all operation objectives.\nAll 3 planets were liberated by the end of the major order.\nApproximately 21 million Helldivers gave their lives during this offensive. They destroyed more than a billion fascist scum. Due to the savagery of the fighting, the Helldivers had a significantly lower than usual KD ratio against the Terminids. The desperate fighting on the swamp planets of the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff sector&lt;/a&gt; will not be easily forgotten.\n&lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;: 10,422,000 Helldivers, 500,000,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 48 Terminids)\n&lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;: 6,206,000 Helldivers, 290,652,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 47 Terminids)\n&lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt;: 4,274,000 Helldivers, 214,587,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 50 Terminids)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Lighthouse.\nOperation Lighthouse is a 5 day mixed operation on both the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front.&lt;/a&gt; The objective was to liberate &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;, ending the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. The duration of the operation is from August 10th to August 15th.\n Prelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe month of August was a new era for the galaxy. The Escalation of Freedom had occurred, and with it, many changes came for better or worse. The strength of the Helldivers doubled overnight, and new weaponry made her an ever stronger fighting force. However, in the far reaches of savage Terminid space, an expanding spore cloud gave rise to new evolution's of Terminids. Recovering from their massive defeats in the lower part of their territory, Automatons also rapidly advanced their technology. The violence had escalated, the war was now more difficult than ever. Helldivers rose to the challenge during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Benevolent%20Sanitation\"&gt;Operation Benevolent Sanitation&lt;/a&gt;, winning all 3 objectives. Operation Finest Phalanx would be the greater test - as now Helldivers have 7 objectives on two fronts. Before the operation began, &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; was attacked. ~6,000 Helldivers diverted to defend the system, as it was uncomfortably close to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAugust 10th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nHelldivers rapidly redeployed from the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff Sector&lt;/a&gt; when the order came through. ~21,000 moved to defend &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; from the Terminids. This planet was attacked at the same time as Curia prior to the operation's beginning. ~19,000 Helldivers began the liberation campaign for &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;. By noon, they liberated ~3% of the planet. The defense of Curia was not going as well, with Helldivers on the back foot by this time. &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; had ~4,000 Helldiver attackers, who hadn't made significant progress by noon. \nOn the evening of August 10th, the first Terminid defense mission of Acamar IV was won. Two concerning problems arose. Out of the ~70,000 Helldivers active at this time, only ~24,000 were fighting on the focus planet of Vandalon IV. Only 16% Liberation progress was reached. Although this would not endanger the operation necessarily, it does leave concerns for whether or not enough resources can be split between the two fronts. Secondly, the Gloom of Terminid spores spreading across the Eastern Front was so large and thick, it began to obscure planets. \n~23% liberation of Vandalon IV was reached by midnight. To be successful, The Helldivers must fight harder in the coming days. \nAugust 11th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe liberation of Vandalon IV picked up speed on this day. 51% of the system was liberated by noon. Helldivers were fortunate enough to have no additional attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; to have to manage. Despite that fact, most Helldivers remained on the Eastern Front despite the importance of the situation in the west. The attack force on &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; reached ~29,000 today. Very shortly after noon, &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the Terminids. Thousands sprung to her defense within minutes.\nUnrelated to the major order, Curia was captured by the enemy. A liberation campaign ~5,000 strong began on this day with the goal of driving the Automatons away from Super Earth. It is not expected to be successful without further intervention from the Helldivers. Throughout the day, an extremely strong Terminid offense made the defense of Fenrir seem as if it was in jeopardy. However, by the night of the 11th, the Helldivers had reclaimed initiative. On midnight of August 11th, Vandalon IV was at 76% liberation. &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; was on track to be liberated by this point, though fighting would have to continue into the 12th \n August 12th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFenrir III was liberated during the morning of the 12th. So was &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; later in the morning, completing half of the bot objective and 2/5 of the bug objective. With Vandalon free and no other Terminid objective open, most Helldivers moved to &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;. A massive liberation campaign ensued on the jungle world. After the Battle of Troost began, the front became static for the day. By midnight, Troost reached 32% liberation. \nUnrelated to the campaign, today saw the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt; expand ever further. Nearly all occupation progress on &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; was lost today. \n August 13th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nProgress was made throughout the morning of the 13th. Troost was approaching 60%. Suddenly, 2 simultaneous assaults against &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; were carried out. By noon, neither defense was going well. Progress on Troost was still being made at this time. \nOn this day, the Helldivers in the East had to choose between two planets to focus. They decided to go with &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV.&lt;/a&gt; The liberation progress on this planet was touchy throughout the day. Even past the evening, dominance over the Terminids was not cemented. Defense efforts on Gacrux were wholly unsuccessful. Better news came from the Western Front. There, Troost reached 90% liberation a few hours before midnight, and was expected to fall very soon. On the Midnight of the 13th, the Automatons were 1% away from being pushed off Troost. The defense of Acamar was barely in the Terminid favor. All other planets remained in firm enemy dominance.\nAugust 14th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nCelebrations broke out across free space following the final destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. Both operation objectives were captured, leaving only the defense missions in the East for the Helldivers to contend with. \nHelldiver forces rotated East to Acamar IV very early in the morning. These forces bolstered the defense, beginning a shift of progress into Super Earth's favor. &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; was barely defended thanks to these reinforcements. On the morning of the 14th, two new attacks began within a minute of eachother on &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;. With the defense of &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; having failed around the same time as Acamar IV's liberation, The Helldivers would need to free both planets in order to claim victory in the major order.\nBy noon, 24,000 Helldivers were defending Estanu. ~7,000 defended Erata Prime. Consequently, the defense of Estanu was going successful by noon, and the defense of Erata Prime was going poorly by that time. &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; had consumed another world in the &lt;a href=\"L%27estrade%20Sector\"&gt;L'estrade Sector&lt;/a&gt;, hiding it from the view of liberty's map. It can be assumed that the strength of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; derives from the intensity of the gloom. By the evening of the 14th, Estanu's defense was won. Now 31,000 Helldivers battled for control of Erata Prime. Their victory would result in operational victory.\nThe increased force on Erata Prime began to shift the defense into liberty's favor. However, as evening turned into night on the 14th, the Helldiver strength declined. The Helldiver advantage was not yet strong enough to secure victory before the time ran out. This changed as the night went on. By Midnight, Erata Prime was mere minutes away from liberation\n August 15th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nErata Prime was liberated shortly after midnight on August 15th, ending the operation with a Helldiver victory. With the pros and cons of the Escalation of Freedom accounted for, the Helldivers proved with this operation that they remained an effective fighting force against the enemy.\nOutcome/Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAll objectives were secured. The Helldivers only lost &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; to the Terminids, while on the Western Front, the automatons were finally wiped out from the encirclement pocket. \n14,335,000 Helldivers died during this campaign. 568,211,000 Enemies were slain.\nTroost: 4,709,000 Helldivers, 137,769,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 29 Automatons)\nVandalon IV: 4,857,000 Helldivers, 152,503,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 31 Automatons)\nAcamar IV: 2,145,000 Helldivers, 128,250,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 60 Terminids)\nGacrux: 890,000 Helldivers, 47,033,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 53 Terminids)\nErata Prime: 1,064,000 Helldivers, 60,964,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 57 Terminids)\nEstanu: 670,000 Helldivers, 41,692,000 Terminids (1 Helldiver for every 62 Terminids)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Prometheus.\nOperation Prometheus was a 12 hour sample retrieval mission on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. The objective was to extract 45,000,000 common samples from &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43,&lt;/a&gt; 15,000,000 rare samples from &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt;, and 10,000,000 rare samples from &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is famous due to a major incident where Helldivers summoned massive amounts of samples to end the major order extremely quickly in under 12 hours (which was the result of hackers). This resulted in the first abortion of a Major Order since the start of the Second Galactic War, with the only prior major order abortion being during Operation Legitimate Undertaking due to the failure of the Terminid Control System. \nDue to the confusion associated with this operation, casualty figures are high estimates. \nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom,&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt; was formed in the Upper part of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Terminid space.&lt;/a&gt; It rapidly expanded and completely enshrouded worlds in a toxic haze of bug spores. Now, it was even causing Super Earth starships to lose radio contact upon entry. Multiple planets that had seen fierce fighting previously had completely been enshrouded, such as &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;. Helldivers have been tasked to collect samples from planets near the gloom to conduct research on how to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;ruthless fascist pest's&lt;/a&gt; further poisoning of space.\nAugust 16th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nMost Helldivers were occupied with a liberation effort on Crimsica before the major order was issued. Within the 24 hours between this major order and &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Lighthouse\"&gt;the last&lt;/a&gt;, Major efforts had been made in reclaiming Crimsica after her tragic loss just 2% liberation percent shy of liberation. This high presence in Terminid space gave Helldivers a significant major advantage. Within 6 hours, 14% of the needed samples were already taken from Crimsica. Progress was minimal on other fronts by the afternoon of August 16th\nAt the start of the operation, the Terminids launched an assault on &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; to distract the Helldivers from their real objectives. Only 9,000 have gone to Estanu's defense. Most Helldivers continue to focus on sample collection, with Estanu's defense unfortunately going south because of this.\nProgress was going steady, with the most progress occuring on Crimsica. Suddenly at some point in the evening, the major order was said to have concluded in victory. It is now known that this was caused by massive counterfeiting of samples.\nDuring this time, Helldivers previously focusing on Crimsica rotated to the defense on &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;. Time will tell if they will be successful with the disadvantage already established. Estanu would go to to be successfully defended, and 100% liberated.\nOutcome \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe operation seemingly ended in a victory for the Helldivers. However in reality, the outcome was poor. Research was slowed and worsened by the vast amount of fake samples which had to be filtered out, resulting in resettlement programs for planets in and near The Gloom to begin. In addition, Helldivers who were responsible for fake sample distribution have had their pet fish executed. Honest Helldivers were not punished, and rewarded appropriately for their efforts.\nLess than 3,100,000 Helldivers died on this operation, along with less than 176,000,000 Terminids. \n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation People's Shield.\nOperation People's Shield is a 4 day defensive operation to liberate &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; and defend against 3 automaton assaults. The objective was to free Curia and prevent further incursions into Super Earth's core territories, preventing the danger of an invasion of Super Earth itself.\nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith the danger of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;, Helldivers were hyperfocused on the Terminid threat during most of August. On August 16th, the Helldivers were &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Prometheus\"&gt;ordered to collect samples&lt;/a&gt; to study the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt;. However, sample counterfeiting occured. With the attempt of making progress in the East foiled, Helldiver command decided to shift back west to the Cyberstan pocket. \nBefore, the Matar Bay Encirclement was destroyed, weakening the enemy significantly. With the Helldivers and Automatons reorganizing following these disruptions, a confrontation became inevitable. With Curia being the closest Automaton territory to Super Earth, the site of the battle was predetermined.\nAugust 17th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nIt took an hour for most Helldivers to arrive on Curia. This planet was at 31% liberation already due to the efforts of the most loyal Helldivers. They reached approximately 50% liberation by the evening. The first defense mission began a few hours after noon on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;. This world of thick, impenetrable swampland became the next victim of socialist tyranny. 10,000 Helldivers sprung to her defense, mostly from Curia. With campaigns in the east on &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimisica&lt;/a&gt; and other planets, not enough support came to Tarsh in the early hours.\nThe Curia gambit began on this day. If Curia is taken, then Tarsh would also lose supply consequently. Most Helldivers chose to remain on Curia in a 2-1 ratio throughout the evening (20,000 - 10,000).\nBy the end of the day, Curia was 60% liberated, and the defense of Tarsh was failing. \nAugust 18th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy noon, Curia was 90% liberated. A 3-1 ratio of Helldivers pursuing the Curia Gambit had occurred. They succeeded not long after, with Curia being freed a few hours after noon. Tarsh was liberated along with it. The Automatons were reduced only to their territories north of &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the Helldivers proceeded to Aesir Pass in order to retake the key system and prevent further Automaton incursions. The other half reinforced the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front.&lt;/a&gt;\nAugust 19th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe second defense of Curia began very early in the morning of the 19th. The Helldivers immediately pounced on the effort to recapture the planet. The attackers had no chance of victory, with nearly the whole surface of Curia freed by noon. When Curia was innevitably recaptured a few hours after noon, the fighting shifted back to Aesir Pass. This defeated attack on Curia made up the 2nd defense mission of the operation. The front was quiet again for the rest of the day. The efforts on Aesir Pass rendered progress as high as 25%. \nAugust 20th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nVery early in the morning, A new FTL line opened from Vernen Wells to Tarsh. This made it obvious which planet the Automatons would target next. During the intermissions spent on Aesir Pass, Helldivers speculated over which planet would be assaulted next by the bots, as 3 assaults on Curia back-to-back seemed too illogical for even an Automaton's mind. Nobody predicted the Automatons would have been foolish enough to launch two assaults. Simulteneously, &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; were assaulted. The defense began a few hours after midnight. Most Helldivers reinforced the defense on Curia. Consequently, the defense of Curia was successful, and the defense of Tarsh was not.\nThe major order ended in victory a day ahead of schedule with the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;. However, with Tarsh still occupied, the direction to go next was unclear, and an automaton presence in the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira sector&lt;/a&gt; was still dangerous to Super Earth's security.\nOutcome/Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Helldivers successfully held the line at Curia, frustrating the Automaton offensive towards Super Earth. However, Tarsh was nearly lost by the end of the defense operation.\n6,885,000 Helldivers perished in the operation. 246,109,000 Automatons died in vain trying to crush the heart of managed democracy.\nCuria: 5,578,000 Helldivers dead, 203,177,000 Automatons dead (1 Helldiver for every 36 Automatons)\nTarsh: 1,307,000 Helldivers dead, 42,932,000 Automatons dead (1 Helldiver for every 33 Automatons)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Brute Force.\nOperation Brute Force is a defensive operation lasting 6 days from August 21st to August 27th on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;. The objective was to defend &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; waves emerging from &lt;a href=\"the%20Gloom\"&gt;the Gloom&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Helldivers had to kill 5,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Bile%20Titan\"&gt;Bile Titans&lt;/a&gt;, and 750,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; had reached its maximum size by August 21st, smothering deep into the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin Sectors&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Prometheus\"&gt;research efforts going awry&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers had to rely on sheer strength to hold the planets against enemy assault. The first target, Esker, had been liberated during thing the &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;escalation of freedom&lt;/a&gt;, and was under attack by the bug stronghold of Bore Rock. On the opposite side of the front, Pandion-XXIV was under attack from the enemy stronghold on Gacrux. In the middle part of the front where fighting will likely be heaviest is &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;. This graveyard world of ice and bones had been liberated after a hard campaign, and now found itself under threat from the spore world Fori Prime.\nWith Helldivers occupied on finally liberating &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; after one of the most tenuous liberation campaigns in history, or in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; attempting to take Tarsh, \nAugust 21st\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe first volley of the battle came on &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV,&lt;/a&gt; the first of the 3 worlds to be assaulted. The attack began in the morning, so the initial defense was light with around 10,000 Helldivers responding. The defense was hampered by the liberation campaign on Crimsica, which had previously been pushed back from 98% due to Helldivers leaving the front too early. Another 4,000 Helldivers also attacked Erson Sands fruitlessly, though the 6,000 strong force on Tarsh was making progress. The fighting on other fronts was contributing to the kill requirements against the enemy. By noon, Crimsica was ~96% free, while Pandion was not going well.\nThe fighting on the first day did yield positive results for the kill count objective, which was well on schedule. The fighting on Pandion was beginning to go more in the Helldiver's favor, with no attacks on either Estanu or Esker yet. Crimsica was stuck at 96%, so close to capture.\nAugust 22nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nNo change had been made in the status of the front until noon of this day. Crimsica was captured at long last, providing many reinforcements for the campaign on Pandion. Operation Brute Force would, as of this point, prove to be one of the most static orders ever issued to the Helldivers. Even with the reinforcements from Crimsica, almost no progress was made on Pandion, nor did another defense begin on Estanu or Esker. By midnight, Pandion was at 52%, meaning only 2% net progress had been made since the liberation campaign began. However, 40% of the Terminid killcount had been reached, along with 31% of the Bile Titan killcount.\n August 23rd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe front also remained static today. The defense on Estanu or Esker had not yet begun due to the slowness of the fighting on Pandion XXIV. By midnight, Pandion was 79% liberated. 48% of the required Bile Titans were killed, and 65% of the required Terminids were also killed.\nAugust 24th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThere was finally hope that the deadlock would be broken on this day. Shortly after noon, Pandion was liberated at last. 77% of Terminids were killed and 59% of Bile Titans were also by that time. Following the liberation of Pandion, the deadlock would apparently have not been broken. Esker and Estanu were not under attack. 66% of the required Bile Titans were killed, along with 91% of the required Terminids by midnight.\nAugust 25th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy noon of this day, the defense of Esker and Estanu still hadn't started. However, the Terminid kill count requirement was meant. A few hours after noon though, the defense of Esker began at last. Strangely however, only ~10,000 Helldivers joined the defense of the planet. ~13,000 assaulted Acamar IV instead. By later in the evening, the defense of Esker would balance out, and see the Helldivers take dominance over the Terminid assault force.\nAugust 26th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy noon of this day, The defense of Esker was won. The next and final defense, for Estanu, had been underway for several hours. By noon, the defense of Estanu was under the Helldiver's advantage, with ~10,000 Helldivers keeping the planet slightly in our favor. Also, Bile Titans were at 94% of their required kill count. \nAs Estanu was attacked, a new defense began on &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;. A few hours after this, &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; was attacked too. Due to how thin the Helldivers were already spread, and with the defense of Estanu taking precedence, both of these planet's defenses went poorly. The defense of Estanu was close, yet apparently successful. With the Bile Titan requirement reached on the evening of the 26th, the operation reached all win conditions during the night of August 26th. With all 3 planets successfully defended, all the Helldivers had to do was ensure no further defensive mission failed during the next several hours. \nAugust 27th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn August 27th, nothing happened as far as the objective was concerned, as all victory conditions were met. Helldiver forces moved to counter enemy attacks. Socorro III and Matar Bay were both defended, and the defenses of &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; were subsequently reinforced; Super Earth has the advantage on both. \nCasualties / Outcome \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Helldivers won the operation. All 3 planets were defended, with Socorro III and Acamar IV also being recaptured. The Helldivers would also be strong enough afterwards to defend Matar Bay, Mastia, and Erata Prime. \nAfter the operation ended, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have significantly expanded. Now the whole &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%27estrade%20Sector\"&gt;L'estrade Sectors&lt;/a&gt; were engulfed.\nEsker: 683,000 Helldivers dead, 39,687,000 Terminids dead (1 Helldiver for every 58 Terminids)\nEstanu: 683,000 Helldivers dead, 47,401,000 Terminids dead (1 Helldiver for every 69 Terminids)\nPandion-XXIV: 5,414,000 Helldivers dead, 306,636,000 Terminids dead (1 Helldiver for every 57 Terminids)\nTotal: 6,780,000 Helldivers dead, 393,724,000 Terminids dead \nAn additional ~358,776,000 Terminids and Bile Titans were killed on all other systems, particularly on Acamar IV and Socorro III\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Ecologic Immolation.\nOperation Ecologic Immolation is a 5-day offensive operation on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; lasting from August 28th - September 2nd. The objective was to liberate &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, and kill 500,000,000 &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. The Helldivers would also have to retake &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; during this offensive.\nThis operation had the misfortunate status of being the point where 2,000,000,000 Helldivers killed in action had been reached.\nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDefensive fighting had been taking place in the previous days on the Western Front. Helldiver forces successfully held against the enemy attacks on &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; recently, and before that, liberated the enemy incursion into &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;. The Eastern Front was held down by ever expanding Gloom, which rendered the front static in all but a few places. With reinforcements free to move West, the time for a counter-attack was right. Victory would mean new ways to scorch the enemy with napalm from a distance.\n August 28th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nA diversionary attack against &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; was launched by the Automatons just as the operation began. The operation started late at night when few Helldivers were available, and it would take time for the present forces to rotate off &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front.&lt;/a&gt; Though many Helldivers would go on to defend Marfark, most would proceed to &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass.&lt;/a&gt; This planet had to be taken to open the path to Vernen Wells. By morning, the defense of Marfark was being won and a good start was made on Aesir Pass. Marfark was liberated late in the evening, increasing the forces going to Aesir Pass. They made significant progress for the rest of the day, reaching 30% liberation by midnight.\nAugust 29th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBetter news from the front came on this day. In the East, the defenses of Esker and Pandion ended, leaving the front almost entirely static. This allowed most resources to be concentrated on Aesir Pass. The majority of Helldivers were on the planet by noon, and had achieved 77% liberation by this point. \nWith the massive boost to the liberation effort on Aesir Pass, victory on the planet was not far off. By evening the planet was liberated. The liberation campaign for Vernen Wells followed immediately. Aesir Pass may have been an easy fight, but the same could not be said for Vernen Wells. Enemy resistance was much stiffer here. Shortly before midnight, &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by a small skeleton crew of Automatons. This force was a tenth of the usual strength, and was expected to be defeated with ease. Simultaneously in the east, &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; was attacked too. Though the swift progress on Aesir Pass is keeping the Helldivers on schedule, only 11% of Vernen Wells could be liberated by the end of the day. \n August 30th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWhen the Automatons realized that most Helldivers would not leave Vernen Wells to defend Mastia, the enemy force here grew to it's usual strength. By noon of the 30th, it was clear the planet would fall. Good progress continued on Vernen Wells however, with the planet reaching 30% liberation by noon. More concerning was the automaton kill count. It had only reached 1/3 of it's required quantity by this time, being far off schedule. \nOver half of the planet was liberated by midnight. On this day, the Helldivers received free &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Strikes\"&gt;Orbital EMS strikes&lt;/a&gt; to use against the enemy. \n August 31st \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy noon of this day, Vernen Wells reached 77% liberation. Half of the kill count had been reached also. Progress continued for the rest of the day. Shortly before midnight, Vernen Wells was liberated. Following this, most forces moved to &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the Helldivers simply had to kill 200,000,000 Automatons within 24 hours to secure victory. By days end, 61% of the required Automatons were dead. Operational victory seemed unlikely.\n September 1st / September 2nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe fall of Vernen Wells the previous day opened up &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, the former location of the failed Menkent-Lesath line, to liberation. Though no real progress had been achieved on any system in the Western Front except for Mastia, fighting here would contribute to the killcount. Only 68% had been achieved by noon of the 1st, meaning it was unlikely for this threshold to be reached in time. By midnight, 78% of the killcount was reached.\nBy Midnight, only 4 hours were left, and 22% of the objective remained. The Helldivers conceded the operation, and little fighting occurred on the Western Front for the remainder of the operation.\n Outcome/Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBy the end of the Operation, the Helldivers had stopped Automaton incursions into the Andromeda sector, were in the process of retaking Mastia, and had taken the two objective planets of Aesir Pass and Vernen Wells. However, they failed to kill enough Automatons to harvest the scrap metal needed to produce Orbital Napalm Barrages, delaying their production. Though this operation was a tactical loss for the Helldivers, every planet gained on the road to Cyberstan is a strategic victory.\n6,562,000 Helldivers perished in the operational planets. It should be noted that many more also died all over the Western Front, contributing to the operational killcount, particularly on Mastia and Marfark. 220,432,000 Automatons were killed on the operational planets, with approximately 169,568,000 killed on other planets. The estimated Helldiver killcount could be as high as 8,522,000 when other systems are included.\nAesir Pass: 2,295,000 Helldivers, 73,945,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 32 Automatons)\nVernen Wells: 4,267,000 Helldivers, 146,487,000 Automatons (1 Helldiver for every 34 Automatons)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSeptember 2024\nOperation Overrun.\nOperation Overrun was a 4-day defensive operation on the Eastern Front. It began when the Terminid horde invaded the Jin Xi sector on September 2nd, 2184. The Helldivers were tasked with holding Phact Bay, Gar Haren, and Gatria, as well as defending against 4 enemy assaults.\nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; had covered most of Terminid space by this point. This prevented Helldiver attacks into their territory, causing much of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; to become static. &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;The Jin Xi sector&lt;/a&gt; was the only place where the front line remained uncovered, so it was natural for a major Terminid assault to begin here.\nSeptember 2nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nJust hours after Helldivers were &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Ecologic%20Immolation\"&gt;defeated on the Western Front,&lt;/a&gt; two attacks against Phact Bay and Gatria were launched. 2/3 of the strength of the Helldivers was redirected here to hold the line. By noon, an orchestra of gunfire drowned out the whole Jin Xi sector. 3/4th of Helldiver strength were here now. At this point, The defense of Gatria was being won and the defense of Phact Bay was being lost. This trend had continued throughout the day. Shortly before nightfall, Gatria was liberated, completing the first of the four required defenses. The Helldivers on Gatria reinforced the defense of Phact Bay, which was just barely in the Helldiver's favor by midnight thanks to their help.\nSeptember 3rd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFor the first time ever, Helldivers entered the &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Sector\"&gt;Sten sector.&lt;/a&gt; Trandor was opened with the successful defense of Gatria. However, it wouldnt be long before the Terminids returned to Gatria. By noon, this new attack was being resisted thanks to reinforcements from Phact Bay, which had been the second planet to be succesfully defended shortly after midnight. With no other enemy assault, the second defense of Gatria proceeded for the rest of the day, remaining just barely in the Helldiver's favor.\n September 4th - 6th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Orbital Napalm Barrages, delayed after the previous defeat, were at last acquired by the Helldivers today. With the defense of Gatria almost won, a fourth final assault began against Phact Bay. This was a 48-hour assault, which the Helldivers focused full attention on. By the 5th, the defense was closely won after a prolonged campaign. This defense would be the Operation's 4th and final defense victory. \n Conclusion/Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn early afternoon hours of September 6th, High Command has congratulated all Helldivers on a job well done, announcing the end of massive Terminid attacks. With &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt; assets on frontier secured with acceptable loses, many colonists are allowed to return to their homes to resume their productive lives and careers. The Bug Menace has been beaten back into The Gloom, where they now hide and lick their wounds. Soon, we shall give chase.\nDuring the 5 days of heavy fights, [TBA] Helldivers have gave their life for the cause. Most of deaths happened on Gatria and Phact Bay, with two minor expeditions sent to Trandon and Partion.\n[TBA] Terminid Scum has been slaughtered and is currently being reprocessed into E-710\nGatria: [TBA]\nPhact Bay: [TBA]\nTrandon: 450,000 (Estimated) Helldivers, 25,000,000 (Estimated) Terminids.\nPartion: 100,000 (Estimated) Helldivers, 4,500,000 (Estimated) Terminids\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nOperation Titanium Belt was a 5 and half-day defensive operation on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. It began with on September 6th, 2184, with the sudden arrival of &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; forces into &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Helldivers were tasked with holding against 6 Automaton attacks, as well as holding the economically important world of &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;. The operation ended in success at the last moment, as the designated number of defense operations was reached 4 hours before the operation time run out. This operation saw 8 defenses in total, with 2 on Imber and Shelt, and 1 defense on Gaellivare, Vog Sojoth, Claorell and Shallus. Defenses of Vog-Sojoth and Gaellivare were unsuccessful, with the other 6 won.\nPrelude\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith their expansion into &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; destroyed, and their advance towards &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; stopped in the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;, Automatons have taken into their hateful scopes the planet of &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;. This world is known from its rich Titanium deposits, which the Socialists most likely plan to use to upgrade their troops. The potential occupation and following plundering cannot be allowed, as this would not only strengthen our hated foes, but rob many citizens from the wage and prestige gained in the Imberi mines.\nSeptember 6th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe Major Order was announced together with two detected invasion fleets breaching into Talus Sector around 18:25 SES4 Time/ 00:25 SEST Time. One fleet breached into &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; system from &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, while the second arrived into &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; system from the direction of &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;. With the Major Order announced, many Helldivers elected to prioritize the defense of Shelt first, as the local SEAF forces were found less prepared, and are expected to be overrun in 23 hours, while Gaellivare garrison is expected to hold out for next 2 days. It was also reported by the colonial magistrates in neighboring to north Tanis Sector, that unknown ships were spotted in the system. It is suspected those are Automaton Scouts, chartering unknown to us FTL connections.\nSeptember 7th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe second day of operation saw the completion of Shelt Defense at exactly 12:30 SES4T, freeing up helldivers to assist on Gaellivare, which bravely resisted socialist incursion with a skeleton crew. The rest of the day was wholly uneventful, yet on the evening a realization settled amongst High Command Generals and Analysts, as it seems despite massive amount of Super Destroyers in Gaellivare orbit, Bots were making significant gains on the surface. This also coincides with a democratic choices of many Super Destroyers, as it seems only 50% of standing Helldivers chose the defense, while other 35% instead democratically voted to shoot bugs instead. \nSeptember 8th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThird day continued the trend of losing ground on Gaellivare, with extinguishing hope for reinforcements. Shortly after noon this day, a small invasion fleet has appeared in &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; system, confirming that it was in fact Automaton scout ships that were spotted in system on 6th. With loss of Gaellivare imminent, many communication channels between Helldivers decided to stop the march of bots in Tanis sector.\nOn late evening the same day, Automatons have thrown their remaining troops into Imber, with clear goal of acquiring massive amounts of Titanium. As Imber was the actual target of Major Order, retreat order was issued to defenders of Vog-Sojoth and Gambit-Strike forces on Gaellivare.\nSeptember 9th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOn the morning of September 9, defense of Imber was proceeding apace, and its estimated that automaton invasion fleet will be dismantled before they can achieve surface control. And while the defense of Titanium Deposits may be successful, the tactical objective of defending against 6 invasions remained wholly unfulfilled.\nSeptember 10th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAfter a long battle, Automaton fleets retreated from Imber on 11:02 SES4 Time. While another attack is suspected to arrive, the bulk force of Automatons has been shattered, and its expected follow up assaults will be smaller. It was 10 minutes later, that reports of two small invasion fleets were sent from south of Talus sector - &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; was besieged once again, as well as bridge to core worlds of Federation - &lt;a href=\"Shallus\"&gt;Shallus&lt;/a&gt;.\nSEAF Analytics suspect both defenses will be successful, with regaining control of Shelt by midnight, and subsequent redeployment to Shallus. If the predictions prove correct (as they always did), this might reignite the belief of Helldivers in successful completion of Major Order.\nSeptember 11th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDay started with Automaton retreat on Shallus at around 5:00 SES4 Time, completing the 4th out of 6 needed defenses. Just as predicted, morale skyrocketed amongst the Helldivers, and bulk forces on Western Front has redeployed to begin liberation of Gaellivare. Yet the eagerness to reclaim what's rightfully belongs to Lady Liberty had to wait, as Automatons have thrown last two, desperate attacks on Imber and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt;. If those defenses will prove successful, Titanium Belt will be considered a massive success, despite unwillingness of some.\nSeptember 12th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nShortly after midnight, the Imber attack was once again repelled, this time most likely permanently. Helldivers then re-deployed in masse to Claorell, quickly gaining ground as they achieved numerical superiority over the enemy. The moon's Right to Vote was preserved, with last Automaton ship being shot down near 8:00 SES4 Time. By then, it is believed that Major Order has been completed, and celebrations were allowed (30 seconds during designated sleep phase).\nConclusion/Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith the crucial resource denied, Automatons advancement has been temporarily halted. Of course its only temporary before we see a new type of strike force in the field, but for now, the citizens can sleep safe. The titanium from Imber will instead be shipped off and used for citizens working in chemistry sectors, to protect them from their workplace dangers.\nDuring this operation, 7,870,932 Helldivers patriotically gave their life to stop Automatons from laying their undemocratic hands on Titanium Deposits. At the same time, 221,908,145 Socialist Toasters have been scrapped and/or disassembled, and their bodies recycled into liberty giving materials for weapons and accommodable housing.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Critical Mass.\nOperation Critical Mass was a 3 day extermination operation on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. It began on September 13th, 2184, when High Command announced a necessary purge of Medium-Sized Terminids (&lt;a href=\"Bile%20Spewer\"&gt;Bile Spewers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;), that most commonly are responsible for maintaining massive hives. By that, the high command hopes to cut the breeding rates. High Command also informed helldivers that planets of &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; contain massive &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; polystyrene factories, ripe for taking to expedite arming the fleet with &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. While this is not a direct objective of the Major Operation, the side objective causes this to be one of rare two-faction Major Orders.\n September 13th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nOperation was announced shortly after rebuffing a medium sized attack on &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;, that was successfully repelled around 15:00 SES4 Time. It was also during this time satellite imagery of massive polystyrene factories on Mastia and Tarsh were taken, indicating that bots have moved forward their supply posts. This movement was recent, which indicates that Automaton forces on this world were still in form of disarray after such change, causing complete lack of resistance on the surface. Meanwhile, Helldivers dedicated to Terminid erasure have already begun deliberate targeting of &lt;a href=\"Bile%20Spewer\"&gt;Bile Spewers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\n September 14th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis day marked no significant changes or attack's on both fronts. Unfortunately, first reports from Super Earth Analytics Forces were provided - Both the Bug Killing ratio and Liberation of bot planets was way below the expected levels, putting a shadow of doubt amongst forces. \n September 15th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAs per previous day, morning and afternoon passed in relative quiet, as slow progress was being made on both worlds. It was only on the evening, when &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; was finally liberated that broke the silence. With &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; completely cut off from supplies and reinforcements, SEAF together with Helldivers begun making massive gains, re-igniting much needed faith in the operation to gain Orbital Napalm. By time of writing, expected liberation time rapidly accelerates toward overtaking the remaining Major Order time.\nNot all was different, as situation on Eastern Front continued its stagnation. With over a quarter of Helldivers assigned to &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion XXIV&lt;/a&gt;, not even this number was capable of procuring even a dent in over bloated swarms. Expected amount of killed Warriors according to graphs will reach the needed amount soon, but the confirmed kills on Bile Spewers leaves a lot to desire, as it seems the fascists have hidden themselves on purpose.\n September 16th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nEntire Night and Morning was spent on a rapid campaign across swampy surface of Tarsh. Emboldened by the complete collapse of Automaton defense, planet was declared fully liberated on 13:54 SES4 Time. Mere minutes later, High Command announced that first batch of Orbital Napalm shells were arleady being shipped across the entirety of fleet. With only 2 hours left on MO clock, Helldivers en-masse traveled to long oppressed Pandion. Alas, while the quota of dead Warriors was reached shortly before the end of time, Bile Spewers quota remained below 50%. No further changes have happened.\n Conclusion and Casualties \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe extermination of Terminid's has been proved insufficient, and Ministry of Science has delivered new and terrible news of even bigger outbreaks in future. The expected cost of preparation for said outbreaks is arleady being accounted for by sacrifice of every citizen - That is by increasing the general work hours by 14% for all Class B and below citizens. Such cruel sacrifice is yet another proof that insectile fascism must be stopped. \nMay Liberty and Democracy deliver us from whatever lurks within the Gloom.\nDuring the operation 10,675,300 Helldivers gave their life for the cause, while also exterminating 356,376,700 Terminids and 135,934,700 Automatons.\nTrivia\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nOperation Liberty Tide was a 7 day long reclaiming-operation on both &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; fronts. After recent updates to armory produced by new and loyal industries, High Command wishes to evaluate the capabilities of Helldivers with said new armaments. Said evaluation is a general call to liberate planets, and thus to check if Helldiver forces can end the major order with positive gains for Federation.\nSeptember 17th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nMajor Order was announced early on evening of September 17th, giving Helldivers a chance to prove themselves. With new batches of upgraded weaponry and freedom of choice, Helldivers deployed en-masse to &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion XXIV&lt;/a&gt;. Yet our enemies did not sleep, as 18 minutes later a relatively small Terminid attack has reached &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;. Forces quickly shifted to its defense, and planet was deemed bug free by 13:00 SES4T on September 18th.\nSeptember 18th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBots did not want to be outdone, and shortly after Gatria defense was finished, Two invasion fleets were sent from occupied &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; into its neighboring systems: &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;. Fleet that arrived in Clasa was confirmed by surface scanners to be twice the size of one recorded in Claorell, putting Helldivers into dilemma, as Automaton forces also have been confirmed to receive some upgrades to their weaponry. Meanwhile, news have spread that on far world of &lt;a href=\"Trandor\"&gt;Trandor&lt;/a&gt;, the expeditionary Helldivers force managed to destroy key Teminid hatcheries, and thus achieving a breakthrough in enemy resistance.\nSeptember 19th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nBoth the night and morning of 19th were put under the realization that defense of both planets in Tanis sector was to be lost, as bots were making rapid gains and establishing more control over the surface. Fervent messages were sent to massive amount of Helldivers on Pandion XXIV. Despite the massive amount of Helldivers in its orbit, they were making no progress of surface, as Terminids were outbreeding any losses. Automatons have established planetary control at 13:30 SES4 Time, forcing a withdrawal from divers on &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the defense collapse, Helldivers from Western Front en-masse coalesced on taken Calorell, hoping to retake it while bots did not prepare proper defense. At around similar time, Helldivers from Pandion begun to redeploy on Trandor, hoping to use the recent change of situation, as by then the Major Order was beign lost with -2 planets.\n September 20th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThis day was marked by increasing redeployment into Trandor, as planet was being rapidly liberated. Compared to its cousin Omicron in the north, Terminid hive was not prepared for arrival of Liberty, as this planet was in their clutches since outbreak on February 17th, making them tame (in comparison) and plump with E-710. Meanwhile, re-taking of Claorell was proceeding apace, while the eternal stalemate on Pandion continued, without any sings of change.\n September 21st \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nChange would come early in the morning, as Trandor was declared bug free on 7:08 SES4 Time, pulling the abysmal liberation score slightly closer to comeback. With barely any infrastructure remaining from times before outbreak, this world offers daring colonists infinite possibilities. Most helldivers decided to follow their strike, and go deeper into &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Sector\"&gt;Sten Sector&lt;/a&gt; for the dark jungles of &lt;a href=\"Peacock\"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;. Others re-deployed back to Pandion and Western Front.\nSeptember 22nd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nMost of the day was spent on continuous liberation work at both fronts. It was shortly before the noon that Helldivers on Pandion were finally starting to gain ground, as it seems the bugs couldn't not keep up the breeding overdrive (Decrease of enemy resistance fell from 3% to 1.5%). It is expected that Pandion will be liberated 13 hours before end of Major Order, thus gaining a meager but nonetheless important victory with score of +1.\nSeptember 23rd \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith Pandion liberation well underway, a message made rounds across entirety of SEAF to be prepared for eventual Automaton attack. Said attack indeed happened, on once fiercely defended &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; at 16:15 SES4 time. While many Helldivers have deployed to it, initial prognosis would indicate that defense would not succeed, if reinforcements from Eastern front would not arrive. On 23:00, Pandion would see itself deemed bug free once again.\n September 24th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nUnfortunately for the defense of Imber, reinforcements never arrived. Despite what was considered a \"very possible victory\", not enough Helldivers were deployed onto planet, preferring &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; instead. Automatons have assumed control of most of Imber administration centers by 16:30 SES4 Time, bringing the Major Order score to 0. With 1 hour left of Major Order, no changes are expected.\nIt is unknown if Imber titanium storages and mines have been moved or depleted. This creates a possible risk that Automatons may have acquired materials for their planned upgrade.\nConclusion and Casualties\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nWith temporary defeat on Imber, the score for Major Order ended up on 0, causing a de facto first MO Draw. Despite massive sacrifices, Freedom was not spread far enough. Yet despite such ending, High Command has declared Helldivers as \"Moderately Ready\". It is suspected that sudden increase in lethality of SEAF forces was a sufficient counterbalance to negate the null liberation score.\nDuring Operation 49 037 000 have Helldivers shown their true grit. During this time 1,799,300,000 Bugs and 516,680,000 Automatons were slain.\nTrivia\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOperation Leap Forward.\nOperation Leap Forward was a 6-Day long operation lasting from September 24th to September 30th in the &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sectors&lt;/a&gt;. The objective of the operation is for the Helldivers to choose between &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; to be the construction site for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, a space station designed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Operations%23Operation%20Starslayer\"&gt;Operation Starslayer&lt;/a&gt; in July, the SEAF uncovered blueprints for a interplanetary battle station on &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;, research was started immediately but the time it would take to build such a megaproject was predicted to be months. In September the Automatons expanded eastward into the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus Sector&lt;/a&gt; this has put them and the SEAF looked into a tense game of intergalactic chess with both sides scrambling at planets and trying to outmanoeuvre the other. This state has continued for weeks with the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; and re-invasion of &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;. But now SEAF High Command has a trike up there sleeve, with the research complete on the interplanetary battle station now it the time to tip the balance and take back freedom.\nSeptember 24th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nNow these months have passed and after intense research, construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; was ready to begin, but first an orbital construction site must be chosen with a large enough magnetosphere. The planets with the right sized magnetosphere &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; just so happen to be in Automaton hands. SEAF High Command has ordered all Helldivers to choose between the two planets for the construction site of the DSS. Helldivers unanimously decided that &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; will be the site of the DSS's construction and by midnight the liberation of the planet was at a small 3%. Attacks on &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; were launched on this day distracting a large amount Helldiver who just couldn't resist shooting a Bug.\nSeptember 25th \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nProgress was steady on &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; with it reaching 14% liberation by midday, &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; stayed at 0 liberation with a skeleton crew trying to liberate it instead on the more popular Gaellivare. The attacks on &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; also failed on this day but Acamar would stay around 50% liberated bolstered by the stubbed few who stayed on the Bug front. At days end Gaellivare reached 29% liberated nearing a quarter liberated.\n September 26th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe liberation of &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; stared to finally ramp up, and by midday liberation had reached 47%. &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; was still at 0%, due to fact only meager forces were present.\n September 27th\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nGaellivare was liberated in early hours of this day, thus finishing major order 2 days before deadline. Construction of DSS has begun immediately, and now its basic framework can be seen by orbiting Super Destroyers.

Extremely well trained and exceptionally equipped, Helldivers are sent deep behind enemy lines through the use of the ingenious 'Hellpod', shock absorbing pods launched directly from orbiting &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; ships. \nOnce the Hellpods land, the emerging Helldivers are expected to accomplish their objectives while disrupting / eliminating hostile presence on the planet as much as possible by spreading the glorious ideals of democracy and completing side objectives to support the larger war effort, all in the name of securing planets for the various interests of Super Earth and spreading \"Managed Democracy\" to their current inhabitants. Unwavering, Helldivers are always heavily outnumbered and outgunned, with only 4 to a squad against an unlimited amount of foes with entrenched and fortified positions, all of which the brave Helldivers are more than prepared to deal with. In the event that a Helldiver is killed in action, another Helldiver, acting as reinforcement, is being dropped to replace their fallen ally.\nThankfully, Super Earth ensures that the Helldivers are well equipped and well trained. Every single one is armed with &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armory%20%28Helldivers%202%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; of the highest quality that Super Earth engineers have to offer. Helldivers are also able to call in the most powerful tool they have in their arsenal: &lt;a href=\"Stratagems\"&gt;Stratagems&lt;/a&gt;. Stratagems are a key part of every Helldiver mission; by calling them in through the use of programmable and easily thrown beacons, Helldivers are provided a wide array of support weapons and utilities (such as &lt;a href=\"Backpacks%23%22Guard%20Dog%22%20Rover\"&gt;weaponized drones&lt;/a&gt;), artillery bombardments (&lt;a href=\"Orbital%20380MM%20HE%20Barrage\"&gt;orbital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;otherwise&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle Fighter&lt;/a&gt; close air support, and much more. Helldivers live and die by their use of stratagems; one properly aimed artillery strike or a desperately needed can easily turn the tide of an otherwise hopeless battle, while at the same time, an improperly thrown designator can pulverize the squad. Stratagems should be used wisely and with great care and caution at all times since most stratagems have a long cooldown to be used again, which is why Helldivers are specially trained for exactly that.\nIn Super Earth society, Helldivers are hailed as venerated heroes, and the fallen as martyrs for Super Earth.* Citizens who excitedly join the Super Earth Armed Forces, out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to protect others, have the chance to be drafted into the Helldiver Corps, which is viewed as one of the greatest honors; to pass the rigorous training and be bestowed the gift of bearing a Helldiver cape, a beacon of freedom and hope for Super Earth and its citizens, is a point of pride unmatched by almost anything. \nReady against all odds, Helldivers are the \"last line of offense\" against all of those that oppose liberty and democracy!\nHelldiver Contract of Employment.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Helldivers%202\"&gt;Helldivers 2&lt;/a&gt;, a contract of employment is displayed on large, black plaques in the Graduation Chamber, near the end of the tutorial. &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Contract%20of%20Employment\"&gt;The entry is free to read here.&lt;/a&gt; You are heavily encouraged to spend at least one second familiarizing yourself with its contents. \nDetailed Statistics.\n\"This section contains information specific to and how the player character behaves in that game.

It is covered with vast, hazardous deserts that can pose a threat to even the best Helldivers. This planet, alongside &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;, marks the border with the Draco Sector, as it contains a supply line out of itself and into &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nHellmire has earned a reputation as the Terminid front's equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason. The entire planet is a dry wasteland where the sky bursts into flames! Fire tornadoes form frequently in the planet's scorching atmosphere, incinerating humans and Terminids indiscriminately. It is theorized that the little plant life that manages to survive on Hellmire uses the tornadoes to germinate, similar to some plants species on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_%28continent%29\"&gt;southern continent&lt;/a&gt; of Sector One. \nThe deserts of Hellmire are divided by narrow, craggy canyons that may hamper movement. SEAF personnel are advised to avoid lingering in these, as being stuck in one with a fire tornado can mean certain death. The \"short period of lush rebirth between infernos\" mentioned in the worlds description is not really witnessed ingame.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nActivation of the Terminid Control System.\nHelldiver expeditions first began dropping on Hellmire shortly after the installation of the Terminid Control System on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the SEAF to push the hated insectoids into the Mirin and Draco sectors. However, Hellmire's hostile environment made it difficult to stem the tide of fascism there. High Command wisely shifted &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth's&lt;/a&gt; attention to higher-priority targets, especially as the Automaton Front hardened during the siege of &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Kwan\"&gt;Tien Kwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation CBCT Protection.\nIn March 2184, several Civilian Biomass Collection Teams were deployed on Hellmire, alongside &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and Estanu. The Helldivers were tasked with maintaining the planet's defense until the operation's completion.\nThough inclement weather forced the sacrifices of many brave soldiers, superior work by the Helldivers kept the planet under Super Earth's control. Upon successful completion of the operation, the SEAF tactically retreated to avoid unnecessary occupation-related paperwork. \nOperation E-710 Farms.\nIn April 2184, the Helldivers were ordered to liberate and hold control of Hellmire, Crimsica and Estanu to enable the construction of safer, more efficient E-710 farms. This endeavour was carried out flawlessly. Hellmire remained stubbornly resistant to Liberty's hands, yet the Helldivers proved they could tame it with their indomitable spirit.\nUnfortunately, the Terminids' hatred for peace knows no bounds. Hordes of bugs quickly overwhelmed the newly-constructed farms, and Hellmire fell into another bloody deadlock.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nThe unexpected failure of the Terminid Control System prevented the SEAF from approaching Hellmire for several months. Thankfully, on May 30th, 2184, the Terminid Supercolony at &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; was utterly eradicated through the Helldivers' judicious deployment of Dark Fluid. This development instantly crippled the Terminid advance, opening a path toward Hellmire once more.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nThe development of the Hive Breaker drill enabled the liberation of planets which had consistently been occupied by the Terminids. In June 2184, High Command ordered its deployment to Hellmire, Estanu, Crimsica, Fori Prime, and &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the late hours of June 19th, Hellmire had been successfully liberated by the Helldivers. The planet's fiery deserts were doused with Terminid blood, enabling its future colonization. The Ministry of Science has calculated a 102% probability that the Terminids will never return, proving once again that Democracy overcomes all.\nOperation Andromeda.\nHellmire would see its peace cut short once again as, due to the diversion of Helldivers towards the Automaton Front shortly after its liberation, the Terminids would launch multiple assaults upon it and &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;. While the Helldivers managed to defend Hellmire the first time on July 11th, the second assault came immediately after on July 13th. Due to the ongoing Operation Andromeda funneling the majority of Helldivers towards the Automaton Front, Hellmire fell on July 14th, alongside with Esker and nearby Estanu.\nPost Operation Andromeda.\nAfter the end of Operation Andromeda, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; quickly began to expand, completely engulfing the world in a matter of hours. The status of Hellmire remains unknown, as any and all ships sent inside have lost signal almost immediately. Hopefully, the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; can fight back against The Gloom once and for all. But for now, its fate remains uncertain."}

According to a voiceline by the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Officer\"&gt;Democracy Officer&lt;/a&gt;, these aliens predate humanity's existence by millennia. They are a technologically advanced, mystical, and highly intelligent species, having gone down the path of electricity in the same way that humans went from rocks to bullets, according to the Ship's C.O. in .\nOriginally, the had been defeated and cast away from the Milky Way, having been made to sign a peace treaty after their final defeat at Squ'bai Shrine in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the century since, the few Illuminate that remained appear to have grown stronger and developed new, horrid tactics. As their numbers dwindled closer and closer towards extinction, they began to abduct and kidnap Super Earth citizens from remote colonies, turning them into the hordes of undemocratic zombies known as The &lt;a href=\"Voteless\"&gt;Voteless&lt;/a&gt;. How many Squ'ith actually remain in the Milky Way and how well they were able to repopulate in exile is currently unknown.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Squ'ith came into existence several thousands of years before Humanity evolved into \"Homo sapiens\", having evolved from a prior aquatic lifeform in their own home planet. From this point onward, the Squ'ith mostly dedicated themselves to their continued evolution, growing extra limbs and honing their skills in the handling of electricity and mystical space magic, slowly becoming a society of supposedly enlightened beings.\nAs the centuries progressed, the Illuminate eventually would come to form a sort of council, the Illuminate High Council, presumably led by the ' and with ' to presumably vote on how they would continue progressing, much like how a tribal council or a military junta would be set up. However, the Illuminate would slowly grow into a brutal caste system, with the Great Eye using its telepathic powers to force all of the Squ'ith into subservience of its expansionist goal. The Illuminate High Council took control of running their territories and slowly steered the race towards an autocratic regime revolving around their mystical space cult and fierce xenophobia towards other species.\nThe Illuminate Empire.\nGuided forth by the Great Eye's visions for expansion, the Illuminate began to expand their domain across the southern sectors of the Milky Way almost unopposed. Captured Super Earth dissidents and brainwashed collaborators tell tales of the Illuminate coming close to \"prosperity\", as their supposed enlightenment brought them new colonies and, with them, ever-growing wealth and places for their wretched kind to spread, obviously at the expense of the native species of the planets they would conquer and subjugate.\nFor milennia, the Illuminate grew into a bloated, decadent empire that controlled vast swaths of the southern Milky Way through their space cult of death and their xenophobic hatred of any other species. But it would be this very hatred what paved the way for their empire's deserved downfall.\nFirst Galactic War.\nDuring the early 21st century, the Illuminate would send reconnaissance spacecraft over the Earth, which initially was taken by humans as a myth. However, after the Great War and the formation of Super Earth, the Illuminate would approach the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; with a peace offer. While it initially seemed that the Illuminate were making a peace offering out of goodwill, in reality they possessed numerous weapons of mass destruction capable of destroying entire planets. With this information and with the inevitability of a surprise attack by the Illuminate, Super Earth would launch a preemptive strike against the Illuminate's colonies in the southern sectors of the Milky Way and forced their entry into the First Galactic War.\nFor forty years, the Illuminate battled against Humankind in several battles across the galaxy, with many veterans remembering their combat prowess with horror. However, no amount of space technology would allow the Illuminate to overcome the omnipotence of Liberty and, in 2084, the Helldivers would successfully defeat the Illuminate at their home world, Squ'Bai Shrine.\nBanishing from the Milky Way.\nThe terms of the Illuminate surrender were necessarily harsh. The Squ'ith were to dissolve their military, or what little remained of it, entirely. Additionally, they were obligated to hand over any and all technologies with potential military applications, with things such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt; being surrendered to the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt;. With the banishing of the Squ'ith also came the dissolution of the Illuminate Empire and the almost complete populational collapse of their race.\nAfter this military surrender, the Illuminate were banished from the Milky Way, never to return. This way, Super Earth hoped that the Illuminate would be eventually driven to extinction, guaranteeing the safety of mankind. For one hundred years, the Illuminate remained a fairy tale for the citizens of Super Earth, with many treating them as boogeymen. Some citizens recall how they would be told stories about how the Illuminate would abduct misbehaving children and take their brains out.\nThe Return\nResurgence of the Illuminate.\nIn the midst of the Second Galactic War, the Illuminate returned without any signal. The Illuminate sent ninety-six invasion fleets towards the planet &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; on the night of December 12th, 2184. The majority of their forces consisted of kidnapped legions of Super Earth citizens who had been lobotomized and transformed into the mindless, undemocratic hordes known as the Voteless.\nAll Helldivers available, both in active service and the military reserve, were immediately ordered to LIBCON 1 and deployed \"en-masse\" to the urbanized settlements of Calypso, ready to take on this returning foe. Fortunately, the invasion on Calypso was repelled on December 15th after three days of grueling combat, with the Illuminate being sent on the run by the valiant Helldivers Corps.\nOn December 16th, 2184, Illuminate forces landed in large numbers on the planets &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Prime\"&gt;Genesis Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mog\"&gt;Mog&lt;/a&gt;, prepared to make a permanent foothold in the Milky Way. This would mark the beginning of a series of raids throughout the southern sectors of the Milky Way, as the Illuminate would not capture a planet even if they won, as they would retreat from Mog and Genesis Prime 12 hours later. From December 16th onwards, they would raid &lt;a href=\"Bellatrix\"&gt;Bellatrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kerth%20Secundus\"&gt;Kerth Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valmox\"&gt;Valmox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andar\"&gt;Andar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Despite their raids being repelled consistently, they would keep coming back afterwards, necessitating a constant Helldiver presence to at least mitigate the damage.\nTactics.\nInfantry Gameplay.\nThe Illuminate behave like a blend of both the and their waves on unrelenting hordes, mostly through the various waves of Voteless, and the dynamics of units such as the &lt;a href=\"Trooper\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Heavy Devastator&lt;/a&gt; from the .\nThe Voteless, being zombies who have been stripped of their Freedom, are virtually the same as any small Terminid unit. Individually, they are fairly easy to take down, if more chunky as they are still humans with some extra flesh for bullets to punch through. When in crowds, it is always best to keep a distance from them, as the Voteless can lunge at random intervals and, since their attacks deal far more damage than that of a Terminid &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;, can take down a player with two or three attacks.\nThe real challenge during fights are the Illuminate themselves. Overseers come in two different variants; the normal Overseers carry laser poles with which they can fire a laser bolt from the hip at a distance or, when Helldivers run out of ammunition or get too close, can be used in a devastating melee attack. When taking too much damage, the Overseers will deploy a blue laser shield that can take several magazines to overpower, which can easily lead to a Helldiver firing all of their ammunition to no avail. When faced with Overseers, the best tactic is to aim for the head when they are exposed and for the legs when their shields are up in order to stagger them and create more openings for you or other teammates to shoot them, all while keeping a safe distance so as to remain able to dodge any melee charges.\nThe Elevated Overseers are instead equipped with a special jetpack that allows them unlimited flight. While flying, they shoot bursts of laser bolts (which bear an uncanny resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"PLAS-1%20Scorcher\"&gt;PLAS-1 Scorcher&lt;/a&gt;'s own laser bolts) and occasionally will throw Illuminate High Explosive Grenades that, much like all other grenades thrown by enemies, can be tossed right back. The best tactic to deal with these enemies is to shoot their fairly exposed backpack when possible. However, engaging them head on is still possible, as Elevated Overseers do not have the ability to project a shield.\nThe Watcher is an Illuminate scout unit. It projects a blue light cone as it patrols certain areas but will go into alert whenever it spots an enemy. When alerted, the Watcher's vision cone will go from blue to purple and, unless an Illuminate Warship has already been called, will immediately shoot a burst of light into the sky, summoning Illuminate Warships to drop in hordes of enemies. If the Watcher can not call for reinforcements, they will stalk the detected player from a distance while periodically shooting electric bolts at the player that momentarily stun them, much like how the &lt;a href=\"ARC-3%20Arc%20Thrower\"&gt;ARC-3 Arc Thrower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentries%23Tesla%20Tower\"&gt;A/ARC-3 Tesla Tower&lt;/a&gt; shoot out electric arcs.\nThe Harvesters are massive tri-legged war marchines that move slowly, but can deal devastation at a consistent pace. The Harvester moves constantly while projecting a blue laser shield bubble around its position, similar to how a Helldiver's own &lt;a href=\"Backpacks%23Shield%20Generator%20Pack\"&gt;SH-32 Shield Generator Pack&lt;/a&gt; would encase them. Periodically, the Harvester will slow down significantly and project a white laser beam from its central blue eye, which will instantly kill any player it touches. If their targets are at close range, Harvesters unleash bursts of electric arcs that can deal devastating damage, much like how the &lt;a href=\"ARC-12%20Blitzer\"&gt;ARC-12 Blitzer&lt;/a&gt; behaves.\nTo deal with Harvesters, players must first overpower its shield using their weapons or stratagems that deal a sustained burst of damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%23Eagle%20Cluster%20Bomb\"&gt;Eagle Cluster Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Airburst%20Strike\"&gt;Orbital Airburst Strike&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Gatling%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Gatling Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Harvester's shield is deactivated, players must then use explosive weaponry against the exposed tripods, making weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"EAT-17%20Expendable%20Anti-Tank\"&gt;EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;GR-8 Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt; crucial in taking down these walking abominations.\nObjective Gameplay.\nThe Illuminate objectives are a departure from how most others would be done.\nThe Illuminate Encampments, currently available in Light, Medium, and Heavy variants, consist of arrays of parked war ships. Light Encampments will feature one saucer, Medium encampments will feature two, and Heavy Encampments can feature either three or four saucers. To destroy these ships, one must first overpower their blue bubble shields, then utilize explosive weaponry to destroy them, either by throwing a grenade into the glowing open doors or using any explosive stratagems. Certain stratagems will destroy the ships without the need to take down their shield, such as the Orbital 120mm HE Barrage, the Eagle 500kg Bomb, or the Orbital Precision Strike.\nThe Cognitive Disruptor is one of the most unique effects deployed by the Illuminate. While within its effect radius, the Illuminate disruptor will periodically randomize the code of every stratagem currently available at intervals of ten to fifteen seconds, with the shortest possible random code being three arrows and the longest being up to eight arrows. To disable the Cognitive Disruptor, Helldivers must either use enough explosive ordinance to destroy its power sources, or destroy the Cognitive Disruptor's four energy conversion panels that are attached to colonial power equipment. Once all four power sources have been destroyed, the Cognitive Disruptor is disabled and players will be able to use their stratagems as normal.\nThe Illuminate Monolith is a possible main mission objective that can appear. Whenever the Helldivers are in the map and the Monolith hasn't been destroyed, the Monolith will occasionally play a voice line for all players currently alive. The only way to destroy a Monolith is by calling down and detonating a Hellbomb within close proximity of the structure.\nIlluminate Language.\nThe Illuminate, much like the , have developed their very own language over their thousands of years of evolution. However, unlike the Automatons, it does not consist of a hijacked language from Earth. Rather, the Illuminate seem to have developed their own alphabet and phonetics, though they are able to speak human languages due to their usage of mind control techniques, as demonstrated by their Monoliths. Additionally, the Illuminate can use their language to further confuse those who fall victim to their mind control, as Helldivers within the effect of a Cognitive Disruptor start seeing Illuminate characters in their UI instead of the normal stratagem names.\nThe Illuminate alphabet is comprised of a series of lines and ellipses, never surpassing five strokes per character. The lines are all shaped like terrestrial cattail plants, with a thin tail and a large, elongated round cylinder head, while the ellipses are always half-circular, never surpassing one hundred eighty degrees. These characters can have a dot at any location, with the points found so far being at the center, the bottom-center and center-right, as well as a small line of even thickness striking through the thicker top of cattail lines. Additionally, some strokes feature a forking cattail line that follows its normal direction independent of its source line. It is possible that these dots and additional lines serve as accent marks, much like how tildes, carons, rings, and diaresis (among many others) are utilized in terrestrial languages.\nIt is not known whether these characters are to be read from left-to-right or right-to-left, nor if they are to be read from top to bottom or from the bottom to the top, as the sample of Illuminate script that can found on the Harvester's legs is written on a longer limb. Additionally, it is not known whether the Illuminate writing system is phonetic, where each character is a grapheme that represents a vocal sound like in English, or logographic, where each character represents a whole word like in Japanese.\nOther pictures of downed Illuminate Harvester, collected during the Battle of Calypso, have been left below in order to aid with the deciphering of the Illuminate language. Additionally, pictures of discovered Illuminate crates, barricades, ramparts and containers, all with inscriptions in Illuminate language, have been discovered.\nIlluminate Culture.\nCaste System.\nThe Illuminate, judging by their appearance across both games, have developed a caste system that classifies them into either government or combat roles. There are those Illuminates with dark blue skin, which are mostly the \"warrior\" caste of the Illuminate and serve on the frontlines in their war against humanity. Warriors, such as the Overseer from Helldivers 2 or the from Helldivers 1, are prime examples of this trait. However, there is also a seemingly elite class of Illuminate, a \"noble\" caste which is mostly comprised of those who are members of the Illuminate High Council. This is evidenced by how the Council Members from Helldivers 1 all have red skin. \nThese different skin colors may have also be related to age, as the different castes seen in Helldivers 1 were thought to be directly related to how much knowledge they have attained.\nRituals.\nBeing a theocratic society and a cult, the Illuminate often engage in mystical rituals with the intent of worshipping some unknown space deity. These rituals involve tall obelisks, monoliths, and tall, shining, metallic staffs and totems that are certainly used for no good purpose. They have spread the false rumor that these rituals &amp; artifacts are actually advanced technology which simply appear mystical to Super Earth citizens due to their advanced nature, which can be dismissed as a ploy to fool potential dissidents into serving their goals and worshipping the Illuminate's barbaric gods.\nQuest for Knowledge.\nDuring the First Galactic War, it was generally agreed upon by Super Earth analysts that the Squids were ruled by an unhealthy quest for knowledge, with the social standing of an individual Squ'ith directly relating to how much knowledge they had acquired. Squids that failed to learn \"fast enough\" would become and forced to fight on the frontlines against Helldivers (a death sentence), while the most knowledgeable were granted the revered rank of or even could become a . \nHow much of this knowledge-based hierarchy remained intact between the two galactic wars is unknown. The Overseers &amp; Elevated Overseers seen on Calypso appear to retain some sort of social caste system (provided the term \"elevated\" does not literally refer to their jetpacks) but what this ranking is remains to be seen. They may have descended into theocratic mysticism, but they still enjoy amassing knowledge. \nTheories.\nThere is a theory as to why the Illuminate have kidnapped our freedom-loving citizens for their sinister plans. Due to their immense size and the fact that the Squ'ith most likely evolved from an aquatic species, it is safe to assume that their home world has a lower gravity and that they would find it hard to move on land. This is due to four primary conditions that cause organisms to evolve to grow to large sizes: \nWith the Illuminate moving from water to land and from low-gravity worlds to high-gravity ones, it would make sense that only the largest and strongest Squ'ith would have the strength to walk normally for a brain-consuming extraterrestrial. We can see this during the First Galactic War, where the large Squ'ith would walk on their legs while the regular or small ones required anti-gravity chairs and suits to move around. We can even see this now, where the big and bulky Squ'ith are the ones who resort to walking while the slightly smaller and leaner ones use jet packs for movement. This shows one major thing: the Squ'ith race is weak enough that most of their kind need the equivalent of wheelchairs to simply move around. \nNow, you might be wondering at this point: \"what does this have to do with them kidnapping civilians?\" Well, you might wanna sit down for this part cause it it not pretty... \nHumanity just so happens to naturally produce a chemical called adrenaline that can give humans(and potentially the Squ'ith) an almost superhuman level of strength, speed, and reaction time. This chemical works by triggering the body's \"fight or flight response\", which rapidly releases a surge of energy that lets humans achieve incredible feats such as lifting immense weights, running faster than normally possible, or dodging multiple attacks from an assailant. If the Illuminate would want to move quickly on land in a high-gravity environment or be able to use large weapons against us, they would also need to produce this super-chemical, and it seems that the Squ'ith cannot produce adrenaline, or perhaps can only produce adrenaline in very small amounts. If the Illuminate wants to accrue large amounts of this chemical, they would need to harvest it in some way, and in order to harvest adrenaline, the Illuminate would need a source that is numerous, reproduces often, and can naturally create large quantities of adrenaline. Humanity seems to be the only species that fit the needs of these despicable \"adrenaline farms\". \nIn case there are citizens who retain any doubts about this theory, you must remember that the Illuminate are willing to consume the brains of Humanity, other alien races, and even their own kind for the sole reason of increasing their own knowledge. They are even willing to mutate our innocent citizens into monstrosities so that they don't have to waste their own lives in combat. When looking at all the facts, can the theory that the Illuminate would kidnap our own citizens, mercilessly imprison them, and brutally harvest them for their adrenaline to be able to move around on their legs be dismissed so easily? Always remember, Illuminate civilization is defined by the complete and absolute genocide of humanity and other races for the sole purpose of progressing their society to even further levels of depravity, hatred, and self-enslavement.

The planet is also rich in titanium deposits, making it home to many mines and a high-capacity storage facility designed to securely house vast quantities of refined titanium. The latter facilities are built to withstand Imber's environmental hazards and extreme conditions, which also ensured the metal's preservation and protection from raiders. Its remote location also provides strategic isolation for valuable resource stockpiling -- at least at the start of the second galactic war. \nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"P%C3%B6pli%20IX\"&gt;P\u00f6pli IX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;. Scorching temperatures, high winds, and low precipitation cause a near-constant cycle of fires to sweep this planet, punctuated by short bursts of lush rebirth between infernos. However under the sands and rock of this sand blasted wasteland are rich deposits of titanium. Moreover, the dry conditions also reduce corrosion and the planet's out of the way positioning made it ideal for also constructing facilities and depots to store the titanium once dug out of the ground and refined. Unfortunately this would be something which would attract the automatons later in the war...\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nImber would become the objective of a Major Order on September 6, 2184, as intercepted Automaton communications indicated that they intend to capture the planet's titanium storage facility. Shortly after being notified, the Colonial Overseer at Imber ordered its colonists to reinforce their settlements and to stockpile weapons, in case the assault at Gaellivare could not be contained. This prevention proved crucial as, a day later, the Automaton forces captured Gaellivare and immediately sent an assault toward Imber. Thankfully, with ample Helldiver support and the appropriate preparations, the Automatons were able to be repelled after 2 days of gruesome desert combat.\nHowever, the Automatons' subroutines of hatred kept on craving destruction and, after resupplying from Lesath, would launch an attack onto Imber alongside with the Automaton force at Vog-Sojoth, which sent an assault onto Claorell. However, the Helldivers were committed to keeping Imber's titanium deposits off the robots' expansionist claws and repelled the assault from Gaellivare after only 16 hours, which allowed to rotate towards Claorell in hopes of a last minute rescue of its colonial defense, in an attempt to rectify the blunders made early on during the operation at Gaellivare and Vog-Sojoth.\nThe success of operation Titanium Belt would see the titanium deposits on Imber retained, and the Helldivers successfully beating back most of the incursions into Super Earth territory. However decrypted intel indicated that the Automatons continue to pursue the construction of some kind of limited-use strike force, the nature of which continues to be investigated. However, denied critical resources, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; efforts to expand their war fighting capability will be delayed. Moreover, the retention of Imber's titanium is a relief for the hardworking citizens who rely on the corrosion-resistant metal to coat the chemical processing equipment they use every day, for many hours. Their continued job security and workplace safety is thanks to the sacrifices made by the Helldivers.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nImber would remain safeguarded for a little more than a week. While the Helldivers were diverted back towards the Terminid Front, the Automatons would retreat their vanguard at the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind valuable polystyrene deposits that allowed for the fleetwide deployment of Orbital Napalm Barrages. However, with the withdrawal of their vanguard, the Automatons would soon find an opportunity to advance towards Imber. On September 19th, the robots managed to overwhelm the defenses of &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; and Claorell. However, while Imber's position was threatened, it would lead up to little ocurring, as the Helldivers captured the underdefended Claorell. However, this planetary capture would be for naught since some days later, on September 22nd, the Automatons launched an assault onto Imber from Gaellivare.\nDespite the deployment of the majority of Helldivers towards Imber, it was not possible for the Helldivers to successfully defend Imber, as a significant portion of the required manpower was left behind at the Terminid Front. As such, despite immense sacrifice, Imber was captured by the Automatons on September 23rd.\nThe fall of Imber caused the operation to be deemed a failure, as its loss pretty much set the balance of net galactic liberation back to zero, meaning that, effectively, net galactic liberation levels had not been increased as ordered.\nOperation Freedom's Forge.\nImber would remain occupied for the last week of September, its Automaton occupiers going on to invade Shelt and then attempt an invasion of Mastia which would be decimated on October 3rd with Shelt's liberation. For some days, it remained as a low priority objective until the Helldivers liberated neighboring Gaellivare and began the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the finalization of the Xenoentomology Center at Turing, Super Earth High Command prepared for the next phase of the Democracy Space Station's construction. Following certain discoveries by the Ministry of Intelligence, Super Earth would discover that the Automatons were conducting heavy excavations on nearby Claorell in order to construct a Deep Mantle facility, a facility that reaches down almost to a planet's core in order to make use of the core's extreme heat and pressure. Seeing an opportunity to both construct a Deep Mantle Forge Complex necessary for the metalworking required to build the DSS and liberate territory from the Automatons all in one strike, Super Earth High Command ordered the liberation of Claorell on October 4th. \nClaorell was flanked by 2 Automaton controlled planets. Clasa, a now heavily reinforced forward command base for the Automatons in the Tanis Sector, and Imber, which now stood as the only remaining Automaton-controlled enclave on the Talus Sector. As such, while a significant portion of the Helldivers chose to attempt the liberation of Clasa, the majority of the Helldiver Corps mobilized towards Imber.\nAfter 2 days of extreme fighting and heavy casualties due to fire tornadoes, the Helldivers managed to liberate Imber, opening the way into Claorell and finally removing the Automatons from the Talus Sector, further reinforcing Gaellivare, and with it the Democracy Space Station.\nOperation Balance of Liberty.\nUp until mid-November, Imber would enjoy relative peace, as the Talus Sector had been under Super Earth control since the liberation of the hostile planet. However, the Automatons, in their hard-wired evil, would once again threaten the tranquility that the sector had enjoyed. On November 17th, after 3 days of bloody fighting, neighboring Gaellivare fell to the Automaton Jet Brigade that had already overwhelmed the Helldivers at &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; during the disastrous Spark of Liberty Operation. As the Jet Brigade was still on the loose, it was a matter of time before the violent strike force would assault the fiery planet. \nIn the late morning hours of November 18th, the Automaton Jet Brigade invaded Imber with a strike force of 18 Automaton battalions, powerful yet significantly diminished from its prior invasion at Gaellivare which had 47 battalions. Few in the Helldiver Corps decided to fight on Imber, as the plurality of the Helldivers opted to liberate Gaellivare, which in turn would cut off the Automaton assault on Imber. For some hours, it looked like liberty would prevail, with SEAF forces turning up to Gaellivare to surge Super Earth's liberation progress on the planet. However, it was not meant to be. As the defense at Imber began to crack, the Automatons at Gaellivare would stymie the Helldiver Corps, buying just enough time to ensure that Imber would be taken before the bots would be cut off. On the morning of November 19th, Imber would fall to the bloody Jet Brigade, with Gaellivare at around 95% liberated at the time of the Automaton capture. Once again, the Helldivers would lose yet another gambit, and the Brigade advance still had yet to be arrested.\nWith Gaellivare liberated, the Jet Brigade had been entrapped in this planet, which then gave the Helldivers a proper incentive to move in and eliminate the wretched enemy once and for all. On November 20th, after many long, grueling hours of combat, the Helldivers would successfully eradicate the last remaining platoons of the Jet Brigade, liberating Imber and the Talus Sector once more and ridding the galaxy of this malignant cabal of steel once again."}

The simplicity of its terrain is both an advantage and a disadvantage, as it leaves little obstacles for any Eagle Airstrikes or Orbital bombardments. However, little obstacles in the environment also translates little cover against the enemies of Super Earth that may reside on this planet.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Expeditions.\nIngmar was one of the first unlucky few to face the horrors brought upon by Super Earth's new but familiar foe. As the Automatons invaded the Western Galactic Rim and occupied the Xzar and Severin Sectors, Ingmar would find its defenses insufficient against the tide of mechanized socialists. Like most of the Xzar Sector, Ingmar eventually fell to one of many unattended Automaton assaults, as the Helldivers were occupied with bigger priority tasks, such as the siege of &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Kwan\"&gt;Tien Kwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt would be inevitably lost around the beginning of March 2184, as its supply lines were cut off after the capture of Mort. It would remain under occupation for a number of weeks, as the Helldivers would be required to prioritize the installation of the Terminid Control System in the Eastern Galactic Rim in order to contain the fascist bugs.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nOnce the TCS was operational, the tides began to turn against the Automatons. Throughout the month of March and into the first week of April, The Helldivers relentlessly set out on a massive effort to liberate the Xzar and Severin Sectors from the metallic grip of the Automatons' iron fist. Shortly after the victory at Malevelon Creek, the Automaton forces would disintegrate after their main fighting force was split in half. The Automaton holdout in Ingmar would be eradicated before the first week of April 2184 had concluded and Ingmar would once again be a free planet.\nAutomaton Reclamation of Cyberstan.\nIngmar would enjoy its freedom in peace for a grand total of 48 hours, since the Automatons, now with a force 10 times larger, was now attacking the Federation once again. They quickly conquered &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Then, one by one, began to take over the planets that were in the direction of Malevelon Creek. Mort would see one small assault during this time, but this would be the only time before the declaration of the war that Ingmar would see its safety threatened\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nIngmar watched in terror as the Automaton forces concentrated in &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charball-VII&lt;/a&gt;, as they prepared for a new offensive out of what the Helldivers had managed to turn around into their entrapment into the Valdis Sector. After a whole 2 months of peace after its occupation, the Automatons launched their offensive into the Xzar Sector once more. After quickly taking over Mort on June 19th, they immediately launched an assault on Ingmar on June 20th.\nHowever, the Helldivers would display quick adaptability, as they managed to repeal the offensive on Ingmar and then liberate Mort once again, which would also cripple an ongoing assault on P\u00f6pli IX. However, this was not to be the end of it all as, on June 23rd, the Automatons opened a new FTL Line from &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; into Mantes. After their surprise attack on Mantes was successfully repealed by the Helldivers, they immediately launched a second attack on Ingmar. This second attack would then be repealed in the morning of June 24th.\nAs of the time of writing, Ingmar remains under the righteous mantle of Managed Democracy. But with the looming threat posed by the Automatons' position on Vandalon IV and their new capability of creating new FTL lines, it remains in an ever-endangered position."}

You are the shock troop of Liberty. You are a highly trained special forces operative that showers Managed Democracy on your objectives. You spill oil and rain blood. You are not the Super Earth Armed Forces (SEAF). If eradication is the goal, then the ground would be shaking under the weight of our troops and shells. They are not needed, you are needed! Your elected officials need you to complete these objectives with precision and heroism so that Managed Democracy can spread.\nThere will be times in which you will be the last one standing amongst the charred remains of the fallen. This is glorious Managed Democracy.\nThere will be times in which you will be rapidly moving between objectives and avoiding hellfire. This is also glorious Managed Democracy.\nKnowing the correct tactics to use in each situation will be the difference between a successful mission with sample extraction and utter failure.\nIt is wise to think of each item available to you as falling into one of the following roles. This will help you synergize either your own loadout, or synergize your loadout with your fellow Helldivers.\nArea of Effect (AOE).\nThese items are intended to do destruction across a multiple enemies. Do note that while it references enemies, fellow Helldivers will also be affected by these items. You will need to learn to aim carefully or risk losing all of your reinforcements.\nPrecision.\nThese items are design to kill that one thing right away. They will pick apart enemy groups focusing upon a select one or two key individuals nullifying their threat. You can use these in chaotic fights or close combat with nearby Helldivers with low risk of friendly fire.\nLight Armor.\nCommon troops are the most frequently encountered enemy. While individually they are easy to eliminate, as a group they often work in coordination with each other to make your life hell. If left alone, many have the ability to call in additional reinforcements. Many a Helldiver has dived their last underestimating the threat they pose. These items are designed to quickly and efficiently remove large quantities of common troops before reinforcements are called. However, many of these items are limited to light armor and will have little effect on medium or heavy.\nMedium Armor.\nYou know it\u2019s a bad day when you see Heavy Devastators surrounding a Rocket Devastator. Unless you come prepared for them. Medium armor troops appear in smaller numbers. As a result, these items tend to have a smaller AOE radius - if any - and ammo efficiency is a greater concern. You can use these items easily on lightly armored enemies, but run the risk of running out of ammunition for the medium armor targets.\nHeavy Armor.\nThere is nothing as exhilarating as seeing a Hulk emerge from behind cover. Every Helldiver looks forward to the chance to spill that oil. But that requires an item able to pierce it's armor first. As heavy armor troops are encountered far less frequently than others, items designed to spill oil and rain blood tend to be very precise and limited in use and charges. You should be aware of ammunition and cooldown time as using these items on a medium armor target is all well and good, until that Bile Titan emerges from the spore cloud and you don't have a way to take it down.\nDefensive.\nThese items are designed to make one spot as free as the Halls of Constitution. The vast majority of them will not move with you, and they are best used when you are required to spend time in the same area completing an objective.\nSo Helldiver, there are two schools of thought when creating a loadout. You build yourself to be a Jack-of-all-Trades. This involves you selecting items that will let you handle most, if not all, threats you encounter. While it sounds good, the trade off is that these loadouts tend to not kill efficiently requiring more time and ammo to eliminate the threat. The other way to build is to create a specialty for yourself focusing on 1 or 2 roles while your team mates focus upon other roles. This synergy makes for very effective and efficient missions. However, the drawback is that if that team mate is dead or you find yourself solo...you will often run into a threat you are unable to eliminate.\nBoth approaches are viable in completing missions. What is not viable is you not realizing your own limitations. This leads to Helldivers engaging in patrols being unable to eliminate them quickly and having a flood of reinforcements arrive within seconds. This leads to Helldivers charging a position trying to overcome an enemy they can\u2019t, which results in their reinforcements dwindling to zero. \nTactical retreats are just as important as tactical strikes. The best Helldivers know when to use each."}

The weapon's main limitation is its need to vent heat, and learning to discern when to back off and allow the weapon to cool and when to expend a heat sink is critical to your success. Additionally, environmental factors may impact whether or not you may want to choose this weapon, as like all weapons with the \"Heat\" trait, the \"Intense Heat\" environmental condition will increase the rate at which the weapon heats, while \"Extreme Cold\" will decrease it. The intense heat decreases the time needed to overheat by .50 seconds while the extreme cold will increase the time by .50 seconds for a total of 6.50 and 7.50 seconds respectively."}

Despite the loss of the battle, the sacrifice of this platoon dealt severe casualties to the Jet Brigade, paving the way for their eventual defeat at the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; on November 20th. For their bravery, heroism and their courageous sacrifice, they have been nicknamed as the \"Lesath Martyr Corps\" in remembrance of their actions.\nTopography.\nLesath is a cold tundra world, compatible to the Arctic Tundra of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; prior to the last great war. Leasth's climate is characterized by extreme climatic conditions with year-round frozen grounds, long and cold winters, a very short growing season and low precipitation rates. SEAF forces deploying to the planet are advised to bring extra layers to insulate from the cold and take advantage of the climate to more effectively utilize laser based weaponry.\nThe planet possesses large oceans and several continent sized lakes filled with freezing arctic water. It's coastlines are rugged with long winding fjords and large areas of exposed bedrock. Inland are rocky mountains, ice fields and deeply cut valleys, with some lowland plains that are broken up by more rocky outcrops. Prolonged periods without sun light, frozen ground and strong winds also prevent substantial tree growth, with a very sparse number of grasses and a unique form of rock-covering moss making up the majority of the planet's flora.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nFirst Battle of Lesath - Automaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nDespite valiant efforts by the Super Earth Armed Forces and colonial defenders, they failed to hold back the automaton onslaught during the opening phases of The Reclamation, with Lesath being one of the planets taken by the socialist menace. On the 12th of April, 2184, High Command issued the Helldivers an order to liberate the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of the namesake planet, alongside Lesath after they were both claimed by the Automaton Faction at the beginning of The Reclamation.\nMenkent Line.\nOn the 14th of April, just 2 days later, &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; had been liberated, and the Helldivers set their sights on Lesath, with an approximate 130 thousand Super Destroyers deploying onto the frozen wastes that same day. The planet would be swiftly liberated, with SEAF engineers immediately setting to work constructing the orbital defences, whilst the Helldivers redeployed to Menkent to counter an automaton counter attack.\nWith the Automaton advance arrested, rudimentary orbital defences were established &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; and Lesath, which were then augmented by hardworking SEAF and civilian labourers. Meanwhile, a SEAF Forward Command Base was established on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, providing fresh recruits and supplies to the front.\nSecond battle of Lesath - Operation Enduring Bulwark.\nIn an act of sinister syncronicity, both the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; launched large-scale assaults on the Federation at the same time. The Helldivers were forced to defend citizens on two fronts at once, stretching their numbers and resources to the breaking point. Despite it's considerable orbital defenses, Lesath lacked the manpower to fully utilize them and stop the follow up ground invasion, causing it to be one of the first planet's to fall to the Automaton's fresh offensive. This opened up the FTL lanes to &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and caused some analysts (currently under investigation by the Ministry of Truth) to question the tactical viability of fixed fortifications.\nThird Battle of Lesath - Operation Metallic Harvest.\nHaving fallen back into Automaton control after the failure of the Terminid Control System and the disaster of Meridia, Lesath and other planets in the Lacaille Sector would be put under great toil, as the Helldivers were diverted to contain the Terminid menace to the east. However, once the Supercolony Spore Outbreak was mostly contained, barring some missed quotas, new orders would be issued by Super Earth High Command: The dismantling of 2 billion automatons.\nThe Automatons did an ephemeral attempt to delay the incoming Helldivers by assaulting the forward base at Vernen Wells. However, their meager assault on the planet failed and the Helldivers pushed into Lesath.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFall of Lesath - Declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny.\nLesath would not remain free for long. With the failure of Operation Metallic Harvest, the Automatons would gain momentum and, as Super Earth began to mobilize its war machine, Lesath would be caught in the chaos, its defenders being overwhelmed and with Lesath being conquered by the robotic tyrants. Despite many sacrifices, Lesath would be unable to be saved and, shortly after the fall of Vernen Wells, Lesath would be permanently lost to the ways of Managed Democracy.\nOperation Ecologic Immolation.\nFrom May to September, Lesath would remain under the odious grip of the robot's iron fist, serving as a forward base from which they spread their socialist plight westward, towards the far reaches of the Trigon Sector, while the Helldivers bounced back and forth between the Terminid Supercolony and the ever growing robotic front. However, Freedom will always find a way to triumph over tyranny, as the Helldivers managed to sever the horrid fief of the Automatons in half, crushing their might and delivering a heavy, yet not crippling, strike at the tin man's heart.\nAs the Helldivers were diverted towards the newly spawned &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious nebula comprised of immense amounts of interplanetary terminid spores, the Automaton Vanguard would attempt to advance towards Super Earth and invaded the Marspira Sector. This would prove to be a grave mistake, as the Helldivers managed to force the Automatons to withdraw back towards their once insulated garrison: Lesath.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nWith the liberation of Vernen Wells on September 1st, Lesath would find itself back on the frontlines. However, the Automatons would prove to be more than a mere nuisance, as they managed to successfully entrench themselves in Lesath. Then, from Lesath, they launched an assault onto Gaellivare on September 6th, while mounting a new supply line to Vog-Sojoth, all while their encircled vanguard at &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; \"coincidentally\" launched an assault onto &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to take over &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt; and its titanium deposits in order to create a malevolent new, unknown force.\nOperation Crossroads.\nLesath would remain as a frontline planet since the liberation of Vernen Wells. However, due to the months it had spent out of liberty's reach, the Helldivers found it to be a massively fortified Automaton position, one which connected to pretty much every other planet on the bot front with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs such, throughout the month of September, Super Earth Tactical Command had been drafting plans for an eventual liberation of Lesath, as control over it would not only serve to reinforce the fragile position of the Democracy Space Station's construction site, but would also severely disrupt the Automaton network, not only by disconnecting the Tanis Sector but also by allowing for multiple incursions into many strategically valuable planets that connected into the Valdis Sector.\nHowever, time and time again, new threats emerged that kept Lesath off the top of the list of targets, both at the Automaton front as well as back at the Terminid front. But, in Freedom's due time, an opportunity presented itself.\nFollowing the defeat of the Jet Brigade at the defense of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, the Automatons were now forced to retreat, which allowed for an opening to take Lesath and, in return, create a protective buffer around the Democracy Space Station's construction site. However, around the same time, SEAF Satellites detected a massive Terminid offensive building up around the Terminid Research Preserve.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Day\"&gt;Liberty Day&lt;/a&gt; right around the corner, the Helldivers had to make a choice to either capture Lesath and secure the Democracy Space Station's vulnerable flank in case of a new Jet Brigade offensive or facing the Terminids in order to secure the Terminid Research Preserve.\nSuper Earth High Command would issue the order for either of the objectives to be completed before Liberty Day, leaving it up to the Helldiver Corps to choose where to send in the main fleet. After some hours of deliberation, the decision was reached that, while the Terminid Research Preserve was important and its loss would present a major setback, the risk of a Jet Brigade assault onto Gaellivare from Lesath put the entire DSS project at risk and, as such, the main fleet began to immediately deploy onto Lesath, hoping to liberate it in time to relief the rearguard force that had stayed behind to defend the Terminid Research Preserve.\nLesath would be liberated by the end of October 25th, shortly before Liberty Day, which allowed its displaced citizens to be safely resettled back into the planet and begin repairs and resettlement in time for their patriotic celebration duties.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nLesath would remain free ever since its liberation, with its colonists rejoicing at the liberation of their sufficiently-sized dwellings just in time for &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Day\"&gt;Liberty Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, where they enjoyed freedom, other planets soon weren't. Shortly after Liberty Day, the Automatons would unleash their most nefarious weapon once more: The Jet Brigade. After having been rebuked at &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; some weeks prior, they had now managed to pinpoint the location of the Democracy Space Station at Gaellivare and had begun their slow march towards it, seeking its destruction.\nThe colonists at Lesath watched in horror as the news came from the brutal fall of Tarsh and decided to take direct action to remediate it. As an act of gratitude towards the Helldivers for liberating their homes, an entire platoon of SEAF soldiers departed from Lesath and towards &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;, where the Helldivers were fighting against the Jet Brigade in hopes on inflicting enough damage to later defeat this nefarious foe. The brigade would only arrive 22 hours after the battle had started, but even then, they would quickly make their presence felt, as they launched themselves at key Jet Brigade positions, giving their lives while dealing considerable casualties to the invading Automatons.\nThese heroes would have had no trouble breaking through a part of their numbers and escape, no matter how many tens of thousands of Automaton Troopers approached or how many fleets of Dropships encircled them. But they knew very well that this was not the way of Super Earth, as it would very much go against the very meaning of loyalty. Instead, they willingly chose to face the entire force of the enemies' war machine, regardless of how outnumbered they were or how supposedly formidable these foes were, and died a resplendent death, the likes of which only the heroes from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; have ever surpassed.\nA soldier's duty is to this truth. Beyond this, there is nothing to be said.\nTo these courageous heroes, the Bureau of Galactic Wide Web Forums of the Ministry of Truth dedicates this small paragraph, so that their example leads all of our citizens, present and future.\nOperation Balance of Liberty.\nFollowing the heroic efforts of SEAF forces from Lesath, coupled with Helldiver victories at Gaellivare and Imber, Liberty shone brightly on the Western Front. However, the Automatons, in their mechanic evil, would make moves to take revenge over their necessarily and righteously defeated Jet Brigade. \nOn the morning of November 21st, roughly 24 hours after the Jet Brigade's defeat at Imber, the Automatons would unleash a sizable assault of 15 battalions towards Lesath. The robots combined the strength of 5 planets to this attack: &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; all sending smaller groups of forces to Lesath in an act of devious synchronicity.\nLiberty was not to shine on Lesath this time. With the majority of the Helldiver Corps and the Democratic Space Station posted at &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt; on the Terminid Front, only around 25% of the Helldivers would join the defense of Lesath at the height of the campaign. As such, the Automatons would capture Lesath by the next morning, and cut off 4 of Super Earth's supply lines to the invading planets, excluding Vog-Sojoth.\nWhile Lesath would not be liberated within the timeframe of the Operation, its liberation would come a mere 2 days after its failed defense, as the Helldivers persisted on its liberation with the aid of the DSS' Planetary Bombardment.\nOperation Spread Democratic Cheer.\nSince Lesath's re-liberation in November, the icey world would see little action in the next month. As a whole, the Automaton front would see relatively little action in December 2184, with the bots only invading &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; and instead opting to muster their forces for future offensives. In this time, the main Helldiver corps would be concerned with the unthinkable resurgence of the previously thought-to-be defeated , essentially leaving the Western Front in a stagnant stalemate of sorts as the bots remained deviously quiet while there were too few Helldivers to make any serious liberation efforts.\nAs the new year approached, the Automatons at &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; would not wait to spoil the festive cheer on Super Earth. The 3 planets would send 12 invasion fleets toward the strategic frigid planet. The bots, in their evil mechanized wiring, sought to reconnect themselves through Lesath's supply line with &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sector&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their forces in the east.\nWhile not a particularly massive assault on Lesath, it would be sizable enough to require at least a third of the Helldiver Corps to repel it. Sadly, this would not materialize as the Helldivers were forced to pull toward &lt;a href=\"Julheim\"&gt;Julheim&lt;/a&gt; to repel a large-scale assault by the wretched . As a result, Lesath's defense would be relatively valiant but ultimately undermanned. The planet would fall by the next day, cutting off Super Earth's supply lines to &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; while reconnecting the bots in the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sector&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the Automaton network, reinforcing and bolstering their despotic domain for the undoubted purpose of future illegal invasion attempts."}

Super Earth discovered that, upon death, the Terminids produced a unique and highly valuable resource E-710. Farms were established on human-colonized worlds. However, containment is eventually breached, releasing the bugs and causing chaos and destruction in the eastern sectors of the galaxy. Simultaneously, a new threat emerges from the west in the form of the Automatons, a mechanical army intent on destroying humanity. Helldivers, who are elite shock troops dropped from orbit to reclaim the colonized lands are redeployed to regain control over stolen lands and ordered to engagen in liberation campaigns across the galaxy once more. \nEnvironmental storytelling is prevalent throughout the game, with various logs, notes, and propaganda messages available for players to find during gameplay.

They carry standard-issue weaponry, such as the &lt;a href=\"AR-23%20Liberator\"&gt;AR-23 Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P-2%20Peacemaker\"&gt;P-2 Peacemaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile no living SEAF units have been seen in-game, their corpses can be spotted on several planets; usually, they are found with ammunition and other supplies nearby.\nIt's implied that the &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20SAM%20Site\"&gt;SEAF SAM sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Launch%20ICBM\"&gt;missile silos&lt;/a&gt; are normally staffed by SEAF Troopers.

It is most known for being one of the final holdouts of the first &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; fleet.\nTopography.\nMaia is a cold, rocky moon. Its topography is composed of a cratered, hilly landscape with occasional cliff formations. It is entirely grayscale, possessing little to no color other than non-natural structures. Its terrain, while hilly, is quite open, making it relatively easy to traverse. This also provides excellent long-distance visibility.\nThe moon is mostly devoid of flora, except for sparse patches of dry grass and bush. It does however possess oceans, though they are concentrated around the north and south poles, and are not seen during normal gameplay apart from very small pools and ponds.\nMaia is extremely prone to meteor storms. Large, jagged rocks enter its atmosphere, burning as they fall - lightning up a purple-blue glint on the impact zone before hitting the ground. The impact of the meteors creates a shockwave, in turn making a small crater on its landing site. A single close or direct hit from a meteor is likely to be lethal.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nThe Battle of Maia began when the Super Earth Armed Forces successfully completed , which aimed to completely destroy the Automaton fleet.

Tibit was liberated soon after, leaving Durgen as the Automatons last holdout in the sector.\nAround 23,5 million Helldivers perished during the Battle of Maia, all of whom now rest on the rocky moon.

There is only one Malevelon Creek.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nThe First Battle of Malevelon Creek (Feb. 8th - 28th 2184).\nFighting on Malevelon Creek broke out in February 8th 2184, with small-scale conflict between SEAF forces and the Automatons. \nMalevelon Creek proved uniquely difficult for the SEAF to liberate, despite seeing similar troop deployments to other nearby planets. The Automatons' socialist programming made it easier for them to navigate the dense jungle, and millions of the robots illegally fortified the planet using exceptionally brutal methods. Resourceful Helldivers began to conduct large-scale deployments of napalm on the thick jungles, depriving many cowardly Automatons of cover. \nSlowly but surely, it became clear that more reinforcements were needed. This resulted in the \"Fight for the Creek\" recruitment drive, calling for citizens to enlist and assist their brothers and sisters in bringing Democracy to the jungle. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; reports that these campaigns were responsible for a 12% increase in enlistments to the Automaton Front.\nAs fighting ensued, the Automatons conducted a savage counter-offensive. On February 28th 2184, Malevelon Creek fell to the socialists along with the entire &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt;. The fall of the Creek was seen as a tragic moment for the war effort, though the Helldivers managed to salvage the situation through the liberation of nearby &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Battle of Malevelon Creek (Feb. 28th - Apr. 1st 2184).\nSuper Earth temporarily lost access to Malevelon Creek due to the fall of two connecting planets, Draupnir and Mantes. However, pockets of valiant Helldivers known as \"Creekers\" remained on the planet, slaying legions of robots in a ferocious series of sieges. Thousands fell before the brutal blades of the Automatons, prompting many to rush to support them. \nInitial engagements proved fruitful, as the Helldivers were able to massively damage Automaton positions. However, their advance could not be sustained, as the Automatons quickly regrouped and counter-attacked. Countless heroes of Super Earth were slaughtered in valiant last stands. Where once the Helldivers traded Automaton wrecks for miles, they now traded rivers of patriotic blood for mere inches. Yet still, the Helldivers fought on. The light of Liberty never left them, even as their lives were traded for Freedom. \nOver the course of the battle, Helldivers began to report to High Command that the severed heads and mutilated bodies of their fallen comrades had been positioned in front of Automaton bases as war trophies. Also reported were a higher concentration of \"death camps\" where SEAF personnel had been tortured, killed, mutilated, and/or dismembered. \nThe Ministry of Truth hereby reminds all citizens that Automatons are monsters incapable of morality or empathy, and that they should never be shown mercy.\nOn March 4th 2184, the Helldivers liberated Mantes, allowing reinforcements to more safely enter the Creek. However, the extreme losses taken slowed liberation progress, and many SEAF personnel were reassigned to help liberate neighboring Draupnir. \nFinally, with both Mantes and Draupnir having been liberated, Super Earth High Command issued a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;Major Order&lt;/a&gt; to free Malevelon Creek from the robots' mechanical clutches. After an all-out push from new recruits and experienced Creekers alike, the planet was heroically liberated on April 1st 2184.\nThis engagement is widely regarded to be the deadliest battle of the three. High Command reports that losses sustained were double that of the first and third battles combined.\nThird Battle of Malevelon Creek (Apr. 2nd 2184).\nThe peace on Malevelon Creek unfortunately lasted only few hours: on April 2nd, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; launched a dastardly attack in an attempt to reconquer this world. Their offensive was supported by two new foes: flying &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Facility\"&gt;Aerial Gunships&lt;/a&gt;, and massive walking mechs known as &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Strider\"&gt;Factory Striders&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce again, the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; were called in to rescue civilians and wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. In the largest deployment to date, up to 230,000 Super Destroyers heeded the call for freedom, determined to dislodge the socialist scourge off the Creek once and for all. \nJust nine hours into the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Forces of Mankind&lt;/a&gt; had completely overwhelmed their enemies: the planet's surface had been completely cleared of the murderous machines. The cold, oppressive wreckage surrounding the planet was all that remained of the Automatons, a last grim reminder of what happens to enemies of Democracy.\nOutcome of the Battle.\nApril 3rd 2184, was the first full day of peace on Malevelon Creek since the beginning of the war. The President of Super Earth issued a decree which recognizes this date as Malevelon Creek Memorial Day. All active Helldivers were issued a commemorative cape to honor their fallen companions.\nFrom that day forward, Malevelon Creek has remained quiet and peaceful, the Automaton threat now only a memory for the Super Earth Colonizers who survived it to remember. Despite the flames of war on the planet being long gone, the Creek still serves a purpose: to remind to the Helldivers that even in Super Earth's darkest hour, their might and determination can light up the horizon with the flames of Managed Democracy. \nAs of December 15th, 2184, there are only 10 Super Destroyers in orbit, each carrying a guard of honor at the Helldivers memorial."}

It compares quite similarly to how &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; used to look like, a former planet on the complete opposite side of the galaxy in the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopology.\nMantes is a tropical jungle planet, populated with lush vegetation and trees and tall grass with the occasional clearing in between. Among the trees, volcanoes may be found on certain occasions which, if they happen to start erupting during an operation, can prove dangerous if not fatal, as the rocks spurted out of them can very well kill anything they catch off-guard, from meager, unfeeling robots to any righteous Helldiver who might just be getting their designated 2.3 seconds per mission to enjoy the scenery.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Expeditions.\nMantes, alongside with Draupnir, would be the first world to suffer the toil of the Automatons. In February 2184, the Automatons launched a surprise attack on the Xzar and Severin Sectors, overwhelming the defenses and taking over multiple planets upon which they would released their mechanized cruelty.\nThe defenses would be fierce and the Helldivers, as usual loyal. They would fight for 3 days to hold the line on Mantes and Draupnir, but to no avail, as the Automatons' trickery once again allowed them to take over the planets and continue their spread of socialism to continue unfettered, as Mantes, and most of the Xzar, Severin and, by that point, Trigon Sectors had become locked in a bloody deadlock, as Helldivers diverted attention away to the East in order to install the Terminid Control System.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nWith the Terminid Control System being successfully installed and operational by the end of February, Super Earth High Command decided to refocus back on the Automaton threat that loomed in the West. With strong determination, Operation Swift Disassembly was authorized. Through the entire month of March and into the month of April 2184, the Helldivers relentlessly pushed against the Automaton threat, capturing planet after planet. While Mantes was not part of any of the operation's objective, it would be liberated roughly around the same time as nearby Draupnir and Ubanea.\nWhen the last Automaton forces at &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed and the dust had settled, Super Earth rejoiced in celebration. Mantes, and the rest of the Western Galactic Rim, were free at last from the cruelty of the Automatons.\nAutomaton Reclamation of Cyberstan.\nHowever. The Automatons were not going to just embrace Managed Democracy out of the goodness of their motherboards, for there was no such thing in them besides innate evil and hatred for freedom. A mere 3 days after their righteous obliteration, they returned. A massive Automaton fleet, 10 times larger than the one encountered before, was now invading the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, taking over &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and slowly encroaching onto the neighboring systems.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nFrom April to June, the colonists in Mantes watched in fear as, one by one, the Automatons took over the planets in neighboring systems. Then, after they broke the deadlock in &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;, they launched a third assault onto nearby &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt;. Super Earth could not bear the prospect of the Automatons regaining their old position and, fearing for the safety of its citizens, authorized a major order with one primordial goal: Keep the Automatons out of the Xzar Sector by all means necessary.\nOn June 21st, the Automatons captured &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt;, just as the defense at Ingmar was ongoing. Then, 2 days later, as their offensive on Mort collapsed and took their offensive at P\u00f6pli IX down with it, they revealed their nefarious ace under their robotic sleeve: The Automatons would create a new FTL Line from Vandalon IV into Mantes and began an attack on it on June 23rd.\nWhile Mantes' defense would be successful, with the Automaton advance being halted on June 24th, it has left a new concern burned into the minds of Super Earth Strategic Command.\nIt had to now account for the possibility of both of its enemies now being capable of creating new supply lines to outmanoeuvre them."}
{"id": "4385", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4385", "title": "Marfark", "text": "Marfark is one of the five planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The name is derived from an Arabic word \u0645\u0631\u0641\u0642 marfaq, meaning \"elbow\". Theta Cassiopeiae -- a solitary star in the northern constellation of Cassiopeia also shares the traditional name Marfark.\nFollowing it's establishment, the Automaton's would attempt to subvert the Menkent Line by attempting to punch through at Marfark. mustering the entirety of their strength for the endeavour. However, despite managing to flank the Menkent Line, the Automatons instead used Marfark to pivot westward and capture the Ymir, Andromeda and Trigon Sectors, holding them for months until Marfark and a series of other planets were recaptured during &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Operations\"&gt;Operation Andromeda&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nThe elbow of the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt;, Marfark, is a planet thrust in an eternal winter, rife with blizards and extreme cold. It's terrain is spread across large ice flows, causing the frigid waters to further disrupt traversal of the battlefield.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Reclamation of Cyberstan.\nMarfark had remained a icy, desolate colony of Super Earth for almost 100 years, its colonists inhabiting its permafrost tundras and thriving amongst the endless frozen oceans and mountainous glaciers. It was of no particular remark, with many other icy moons like it spread across the galaxy. However, if there is anything that the enemies of Super Earth hate...is peace.\nOn April 3rd, 2184, shortly after their crushing, unapologetic defeat at Malevelon Creek and the righteous obliteration of their Expeditionary Forces; the Automatons, through some unknown and most likely tyrannical and undemocratic means, returned to fight Super Earth on force. They quickly overwhelmed and conquered &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and began to rush for the neighboring sectors. As the Helldivers scrambled back into the fight against the mechanized menace, the colonists at Marfark saw in horror and despair how, one by one, its surrounding planets fell to the red tides of socialism.\nThen, on April 16th, as the Helldivers managed to stop the Automaton advance at the &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; line, Marfark faced its first robotic assault, as the Automatons rushed to try and outflank the defenses. \nWar had been brought upon their doorstep.\nMenkent Line and Operation Cassiopeia.\nThroughout the months of April and May, Marfark would see 2 assaults that displaced its surviving colonists and destroyed their icy dwellings, as the Helldivers fought tooth and nail to hold the line against the tyrannical machines.\nOn April 16th SEAF forces had managed to liberate half of the Automaton presence on Marfark when uptick in the bots resistance was noticed, including the re-appearance of &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Strider\"&gt;Factory Striders&lt;/a&gt; in large numbers. Not long after the order came in from High Command to hold the planet, in order to secure the vulnerable flank of the Menkent Line. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; would redouble their efforts against the bots before their main automaton fleet could be redirected to the system, even redirecting forces from the bloody fighting on &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter heavy fighting throughout the remainder of the day and into early hours of the following morning, their efforts would pay off as the last of the Automaton holdouts would be crushed. Although S.E.A.F. forces braced for a possible follow up attack by the Automatons, no further offensives would materialize for the rest of the day (likely due to the toasters loosing their footholds and much of their heavy equipment on the arctic world), with High Command declaring the defense of the planet a resounding success.\nWith Marfark secure, the Helldivers would redirect their efforts to other fronts such as &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;\nHowever, as the Terminid Control System failed in the East, the Helldivers would be forced to divert power in order to contain the now resurgent supercolony, which would ultimately doom Marfark to a fate worse than conquest by the Automatons, as it would be stuck on a deadlock.\nSecond Galactic War.\nMarfark had fallen out of Liberty's grace. As the Terminids and Automatons constantly forced the Helldivers to split and separate, more and more planets fell to the Automaton waves. Marfark would be lost in May, opening the gates for an assault on Aesir Pass that would be unsuccessful. But, such a fate was not to be the end for the icy bastion.\nOperation Trolley Problem.\nBy June, Marfark had been at least 4 weeks under the iron fist of the robots. But, it would be these barbarous occupation what would give it a glimpse of hope. The Automatons had brought to it a large repository of explosives, which would be determined by SEAF analysts to be necessary for the production of MD-17 Anti-tank mines. However, this discovery would occur at the same time that a distress signal came from the ruins of the Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children at nearby &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Helldivers with a choice to make: Save the trapped civilians at Vernen Wells or secure the explosives at Marfark, since only the first planet to be liberated would have its civilians or material secured.\nAfter the liberation of Aesir Pass in June 12th, the Helldivers began to dive towards both planets, with the majority picking Vernen Wells. While this may seem to be the end for the explosive caches, the icy bastion of Marfark may have one more chance at enjoying the sweet embrace of Managed Democracy again.\nUnfortunately following the liberation of Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; appear to have become aware of our efforts to liberate the &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;Anti-Tank Mine&lt;/a&gt; materials on Marfark, and initiated operations to transport the material off-planet. Despite liberating 65% of the planet's surface, within 24 hours the bots were able to move the explosives cache deeper within their territory.\nMarfark remained in &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; hands, with the federation's &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mine&lt;/a&gt; factories being shuttered for the time being, following multiple successive material shortfalls. The adult and pre-adult workers in those factories have been reassigned to other gainful and safe employment.\nOperation Andromeda.\nWith impossible victory achieved in &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt; decided to (after brief reprise in form of bug killing) reconnect with the stranded SEAF forces. A great liberation operation was called, with intend of both creating a supply line to besieged Ymir sector, as well as cutting the Bot territory in half. First hellpods landed on late afternoon of July 13th, while most of the SEAF was busy liberating &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Proper liberation begun the next day, and after 2 days of fierce fighting, Marfark was liberated on morning of July 16th, fully opening the way to a planet that harbored a most shameful SEAF defeat - &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Jet Brigade and the Miracle at Marfark.\nOn October 18th, 2184, Automaton warships have appeared in massive numbers in the atmosphere of &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple SEAF bases fell within hours and by the end of the day so too would the planet. Reports indicate the presence of an augmented Automaton detachment leading the invasion, equipped with jetpack technology. This detachment will be referred to as the Jet Brigade in all communications.\nThe size of this assault was unprecedented, with Super Earth High Command assessing that some loss of territory would be unavailable. Sure enough, Matar bay fell by the end of the day, with a subsequent invasion of neighboring &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; happening soon after, with that planet also falling to the mechanized socialists. However, every bot decommissioned weakened the strength of their advance, until the Jet Brigade launched an assault on Marfark on October 21st.\nAlthough the automatons were severely weakened by previous engagements, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver&lt;/a&gt; forces on the previous two planets, it would take every drop of blood and oil that the unified forces of humanity had at their disposal to hold the planet.\nThough the Department of Heroic Sacrifice Affairs would have much work to do in the following weeks, victory was achieved by the most narrowest of margins on October 22nd, with Marfark becoming the sight of another heroic victory for the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. However despite the Miracle at Marfark, the Jet Brigade remains a significant, albeit diminished, threat. We must remain ever-vigilant against future attacks. But for now, Liberty has won a great victory.\nOperation Jetclipper.\nFollowing the miraculous and righteous defeat of the Jet Brigade at Marfark, the planet's icy and snowy peaks glimmered with the spark of liberty, a beacon in the Federation of Super Earth. However, this peace would soon come under grave threat once more. In the month after the Helldiver victory against the Jet Brigade, Marfark would begin to become encircled as the bots maintained control of &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, and then went onto easily capture &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; once more in the &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Sector\"&gt;Hydra Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Then, on the morning of November 28th, the Automaton occupiers at the problematic sandy planet of &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; would send 12 battalions toward &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to regain a foothold in the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The bots would easily take control of Matar Bay by the next day as the rest of the Helldiver corps was concerned with Operation Iron Fleet against the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe writing was on the wall now for Marfark, as it was now surrounded completely by Automaton-controlled planets in a complete encirclement. The colonists' worst fears would come true as Marfark was once again invaded by the Automatons on the morning of November 29th, with the Automatons sending forces from all of Matar Bay, Martale, and Aesir Pass.\nYet hope was not lost. \nOn morning of November 30th, besieged world was graced by the reinforcements of Helldivers, which managed to agree on course of action after fight for &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt; proved inefficient. While the initial predictions remained grim, the brave elite slowly managed to dislodge the sudden toaster occupation, and strike back at invading forces. \nThus, a second Miracle at Marfark has happened, and by early morning of December 1st, last of invading's forces were decommissioned. Yet despite this positive outlook, Marfark remains encircled, and it will be only a matter of time before its icy ramparts will be tested yet again, while the rest of Helldivers on Western Front remain purposefully spread out."}

Much of the land is composed of stony hills, with some tall coastal cliffs. Green auroras and large moons cover the night sky. Much of the surface is covered in short foliage, and there are many large bodies of water. Human settlement has brought many structures and small farms to be established. The biosphere makes Martale an ideal location for life.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nFall of Martale.\nThe soulless mechanical socialist plague, self-denominated as the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Northwestern Area of the galaxy&lt;/a&gt; on April 9th, 2184. Martale quickly became a frontline planet, having previously being out of harm's way. With the failure of &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Courageous%20Defense\"&gt;Operation Courageous Defense&lt;/a&gt;, The planet was stolen from the warm, loving hold of Liberty, showing that the red pest of marxist space robots will go to any length to ruin humanity. \nThe fate of the human settlers on Martale is not known currently. With the successful establishment of the Menkent-Lesath defensive line by SEAF engineers, Helldiver forces regained the initiative in the front. The effort to liberate Martale was slow at first, but with the rapid liberation of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Cassiopeia, the planet began to see significant efforts towards liberation. On the 17th of April, 2184, The planet became the focal point of Helldiver attention with &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; having been secured already. \nSEAF forces made swift progress to reclaim this world, despite the strong automaton presence. However on April 18th, A new major order was announced, shifting Helldiver attention to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; at a time when the world was almost (85%) liberated. The planet fell out of strategic prominence and little progress was made in the early hours of April 18th. Some Helldiver forces began to shift their focus back towards the planet later in the day after the massive success on the Eastern Front against the &lt;a href=\"terminids\"&gt;terminids&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Martale Gambit (April 19th-20th, 2184).\nIn act of sinister synchronicity, both the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; would launch large-scale offensives on April 19th, forcing the Helldivers to defend citizens on two fronts at once. The bots assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;western front&lt;/a&gt; would target &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, with the FTL line of Martale enabling the latter offensive. However High Command realized that the Automaton Legions had made a critical error. In a stroke of strategic brilliance second to only the work of General Brasch himself, the idea to seize Martale to cut off supply lines to Charon Prime was proposed.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt; were reliant on FTL supply lines which went through the Martale system and that if the planet were liberated, then those supply lines would be cut, forcing the bots to abandon Charon Prime, effectively a reversal of the disaster that took place on &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt;. This was also something of a gamble as although the planet was close to full liberation, the simultaneous attack across all fronts had stretched S.E.A.F. forces thin, the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; included. By April 20th, Martale had reached 94.4% liberation before an Automaton assault overwhelmed S.E.A.F forces defending both Marfark and Charon Prime. From that point onward, The Martale Blunder was remembered as one of most shameful defeats.\nWith supplies running low and the Helldivers unable to break the deadlock, S.E.A.F. forces on Martale were ordered to be evacuated. The Automatons would gain full control over the once free and beautiful world. \nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Andromeda.\nHowever, Martale's fate was not sealed. From April to July, Martale would be under Automaton Occupation as, in their unquenchable thirst for control, the Automatons over-extended their usurpation, spanning an odious fief that went from &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Merga%20IV\"&gt;Merga IV&lt;/a&gt;, with Cyberstan as the tin man's maleficent heart.\nThis over-extension would prove to be the backdoor of the Automatons as the Helldivers successfully secured access to the Petafactory in &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, Database One in &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; and the plans for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Intergalactic Battle Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;. With the momentum behind them, and with the Terminids now contained once more after Operation Enduring Peace, Super Earth issued a major order that requested the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Marfark, Matar Bay and Martale, all in hopes of splitting the overstretched robotic forces in half, turning the tide of war in Super Earth's favor.\nThe battle to retake Martale began on July 14th 2184. Fighting was very slow until the early morning of July 17th 2184, when Helldiver forces had finally liberated &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the initially lackluster force of ~11,000 Helldivers, the liberation force nearly doubled after the liberation of Marfark. This, along with the bolstering effects of the isolation of this part of the automaton frontline, caused a swift liberation. The planet's beauty has seemed to diminish sadly, with a much higher amount of broken machine parts strewn about the landscape. \nWith this planet liberated, those who perished in the Martale Gambit of April that achieved 94% liberation had been avenged, finally freeing this planet, and successfully completing Operation Andromeda.\nOperation Jet Brigade.\nWith the terrors from the early months of the war behind them, the colonists of Martale began the slow, difficult process of resettling and repairing their homes, lost during the inital phase of the Reclamation. Between July and August, the colonists worked hard in order to not only re-establish their settlements but also to continue contributing to the Federation's growth and economy. However, the months kept going by and the Automatons would eventually begin recovering from the severe strike they had been dealt. And so...they set out to retake what had been righteously recovered from their vicious clutches.\nOn October 20th, after the Automatons successfully recaptured Matar Bay, their new special strike force known as \"The Jet Brigade\" continued its attacks, as they brutishly searched for the location of the Democracy Space Station. As such, the Helldivers heeded Martale's call for aid when the Jet Brigade made it its new target.\nEven after enduring heavy losses at the battle of Matar Bay, the Jet Brigade overwhelmed the colonial defenses and the Helldivers, capturing Martale on the early hours of October 20th, yet incurring even more casualties and failing to discover the DSS once more.\nAs liberation efforts were being made, the Automatons continued to search and capture planets within their reach. In the end however, Martale's sacrifice would be worth it as the Jet Brigade was finally defeated by the narrowest of margins on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; on October 22nd."}

However, semi-frequent Sandstorms temporarily reduce the vision to extremely close distances. However, they easily mask Helldiver presence, allowing to strike at enemy, and then withdraw into the storm.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nDuring the first months of the War, Mastia enjoyed its far distance from Automaton advancements, as by then they were interested in gains in &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;. However, this false sense of safety was soon going to be shattered by the Automatons.\nOperation Brute Force.\nShortly before the noon of August 27th, Mastia was attacked by a small, most likely vanguard force from neighboring Tarsh. Helldivers instantly threw themselves to the defense, as the Major Order active by then was already completed, and planet possessed weather patterns that Helldivers found more democratic than others (As voted in local election by landslide of 80% votes). The attack was repelled in 12 hours, shredding all ships found on orbit.\nOperation Ecologic Immolation.\nHowever, the Automatons were not discouraged, and on the early morning hours of August 29th, they attacked one more time, by similarly sized force. The local governor proceeded to sent a transmission claiming full combat readiness of the planet, indicating it would take Automatons more than 10 days to overwhelm the defenses. This message proved to be false, as the local colonial officials had failed to properly fortify the planet and the planet was taking on far more mechanized fighters than it could handle. \nWith most of forces stuck on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, the desert planet fell the following day, giving the socialist forces a chance to entrench. With liberation of The Wells the following day, both Mastia and Tarsh were cut off from the main Automaton supply line.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nMastia would remain in Automaton hands, providing a staging ground for further invasions into Talus Sector during Operation Titanium Belt. Despite numerous sacrifices, robots stood firm on the dunes, routing and hunting down the remaining SEAF personnel stuck on surface. During that time FTL lines to Cyberstan were set up through neighboring &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;, halting any liberation progress.\nOperation Critical Mass.\nWith the announcement of this new operation, and subsequent information that Automatons had placed massive manufactories of polystyrene, Mastia saw a rapid and massive arrival of divers eager to help arm their ships with &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrages&lt;/a&gt;. Due to fact that Bots had only recently brought forward the production, most of planet was in disarray, and many tactical assets were still being moved around.\nProper liberation began on September 13th, as massive in-channel campaigns were raised with hopes of additional divers for the cause. High Command suspected that bots would try to evacuate the machines in factories in 3 days of the operation, thus giving divers a tough choice between either permanently equipping themselves with powerful tool, or shooting bugs in hopes of completing the Major Order.\nThe planet returned into Liberty's embrace on evening of September 15th, and manufactories of polystyrene are being repurposed and inspected for future use, with the newly deployed Orbital Napalm Barrages managing to help Helldivers kill enough Terminid Warriors to at least meet 1 of the 2 target quotas for Terminid eradication.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nFollowing Mastia's liberation on September 15th, the planet would see relative peace for nearly 2 months. However, this peace would soon be in peril once more. From November 8th to November 11th, the Automatons would begin amassing Jet Brigade forces on Vernen Wells in the &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Sector\"&gt;Hydra Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt; would be threatened once more, and on the afternoon of November 11th, the Automatons, led by the Jet Brigade, would launch the single biggest invasion seen during the entirety of the second galactic war so far on neighboring Tarsh, with a force of 58 Automaton battalions. Despite significant resistance from the Helldivers, the Automatons would easily capture Tarsh by the next day, pinpointing the location of the Democracy Space Station at nearby Gaellivare.\nMastia would soon find itself once more under grave threat against the despotic robots. With Mastia standing as the sole obstacle to the Automatons' goal of reaching Gaellivare, it was only a matter of time before the sandy planet would face the deadly strike force. Roughly 9 hours after the capture of Tarsh by the Jet Brigade, the Automatons would invade Mastia at midnight on November 13th, with a still massive fleet of 43 Automaton Battalions.\nThe battle for Mastia was as gruesome as the one that preceded it, with the SEAF and the Helldivers combining all of their strength in order to protect as many citizens of all ratings as possible. But despite this, the situation became more and more untenable. Despite all the sacrifices, the battle began to look lost, while the Jet Brigade didn't seem to lose any strength at all from what they previously had at Tarsh.\nBut when Tyranny's shadow is at its darkest, it is when Liberty's flames shine the brightest. Hours before the collapse of Mastia's defense, a platoon of SEAF reinforcements would come in from the most unlikely of places: &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;. As an act of gratitude for the liberation of their homes during Operation Crossroads, this heroic platoon would valiantly capture key Jet Brigade positions on the planet, inflicting massive casualties on the invading force. While it is still unknown exactly how much of the enemy force was felled by these courageous warriors, some SESF analysts estimate that at least 10% of the invading force was successfully eliminated thanks to the sacrifice of these noble martyrs.\nThese heroes would have had no trouble breaking through a part of their numbers and escape, no matter how many tens of thousands of Automaton Troopers approached or how many fleets of Dropships encircled them. But they knew very well that this was not the way of Super Earth, as it would very much go against the very meaning of loyalty. Instead, they willingly chose to face the entire force of the enemies' war machine, regardless of how outnumbered they were or how supposedly formidable these foes were, and died a resplendent death, the likes of which only the heroes from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; have ever surpassed.\nA soldier's duty is to this truth. Beyond this, there is nothing to be said. \nTo these courageous heroes, the Bureau of Galactic Wide Web Forums of the Ministry of Truth dedicates this small paragraph, so that their example leads all of our citizens, present and future."}
{"id": "4154", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4154", "title": "Matar Bay", "text": "Matar Bay is one of the five planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt;. On October 28th, 2184, it became the first planet to fall to the malevolent Jet Brigade assault brigade of the Automatons.\nTopography.\nThe landscape of Matar Bay shares some similarities with the pre-great war Scottish highlands, leading some &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; to call the planet Space Scotland. The planet is well suited to human habitation, with the misty highland terrain prepossessing lush grass-life, several large continent sized lakes and vast oceans. Rocky outcrops expose the skeleton of the mountain landscape with a vegetative skin of heath and grasses covering most of it. Swathes of flowering heather together with patches of moss and pasture form a visually diverse but integrated landscape.\nMuch like old-scotland back on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, Matar Bay does not have a dry season or a wet season, instead, rainfall is fairly consistent across the year, with some months wetter than others and thunderstorms being a common occurrence. The planet also possesses a unique native wildlife in the form of luminescent floating jellyfish which can be seen floating in the air, ranging in size from the size of a human palm to being larger than a Super Bowling Ball. Whilst appearing to be non-aggressive, field observations have noted that larger specimens also have the ability to shoot out their own bolts of electricity, seemingly at random. Investigations into whether this electric sting is lethal or not are ongoing.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nMatar Bay had laid in harmonious peace with Super Earth since its colonization up until the month of April 2184. As the Automatons, their motherboards bitter with defeat after their complete eradication in &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, launched a sudden invasion of the Valdis Sector, taking over Cyberstan and igniting a second round of conflict in the Western Galactic Rim. As the Helldivers scrambled, Matar Bay's colonial defenses would be eventually overwhelmed and it would inevitably fall into the mechanical grip of the Automaton regime.\nEver since, it has been illegally and unjustly occupied by the tyrannical machines, who have made use of its as a pivot from which they can spread their socialist terror upon &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, then the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt; and as a nexus from which they most likely attacked &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;'s Petafactory and pushed towards Meissa and &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; and, subsequently, attempted 2 takeovers of the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Starslayer.\nMatar Bay would not see much action itself after its invasion. From May to June, it would endure unimaginable horrors under the iron fist of the Automatons. However, in July, a glimmer of hope would emerge from an unlikely source: Meissa.\nWhile the Helldivers fought to defend X-45 in hopes of recovering lost blueprints from the First Galactic War, they would secure Vega Bay, Wasat and Meissa as a buffer zone, the first two having been previously recovered during Operation Valiant Resistance in June.\nWith Meissa secured, small sorties and raids would be sent towards Matar Bay, in order to weaken its defenses, as most of the Helldiver Corps focused on defending X-45.\nAfter 6 days, the blueprints would be recovered in X-45, with Super Earth having gained new possibilities and reclaimed many of its lost colonies.\nOperation Andromeda.\nAfter enduring 3 months of occupation, Super Earth High Command, having finally regrouped and regained ground after the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23TCS%20Failure\"&gt;disaster at Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and their victories at &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would launch a new offensive with the ultimate goal of severing the Automaton Forces in half, which would strike a decisive blow to the robotic foes.\nAfter successfully recovering Meissa during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Starslayer\"&gt;Operation Starslayer&lt;/a&gt;, Super Earth now stood a fighting chance against the Automatons. Despite the tragic loss of a SEAF Garrison on Aesir Pass, the order was given for the Helldivers to capture Matar Bay, alongside with Martale, Marfark and Aesir Pass. Matar Bay would be swiftly captured on July 13th, with the operation successfully concluding on July 15th\nOperation Righteous Expunge.\nShortly after Operation Andromeda, Matar Bay would remain in relative peace, although still having impending danger coming towards it from nearby Choohe, a fortified planet right at the triple border between the Andromeda, Lacaille and Valdis Sectors. On July 19th, the Automatons would try to punch through Matar Bay to rescue their encircled southern garrisons, but would be successfully repelled.\nOperation Brute Force.\nSince its liberation, Matar Bay would once again breathe the air of freedom, as the weakened and defeated machines were expunged out of the encirclement. However, the Automatons would begin amassing their forces in order to attempt an even worse offensive. On August 11th, the Automatons punched through &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the war, initiating an invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Marspira%20Sector\"&gt;Marspira Sector&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the Helldivers were ordered to defend the Marspira Sector by all means necessary and, by August 18th, they would mostly succeed, repelling the Automaton offensive and sending them back into their occupied fief. However, the Helldivers would once again be ordered away towards the Terminid front in order to contain the new threat presented by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeing an opportunity, the Automaton garrison in Choohe launched an assault towards Matar Bay in conjunction with the Tarsh's Automaton Vanguard, which launched an assault onto &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;. This happened while the Helldivers were occupied defending &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; from the incoming Terminid onslaughts that were now bolstered by the odious nebula.\nHowever, the Automatons did not count with the indomitable spirit of Liberty that resides within the heart of every man, woman and child over 7 that is enlisted into the Helldiver Corps as, shortly after the defense of &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt; and the liberations of &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would successfully repel both Terminid offensives on Estanu and Socorro then quickly turn towards Matar Bay, repelling the Automaton offensive at the last minute, then quickly turning back towards Mastia and Erata Prime.\nOperation Jet Brigade.\nMatar Bay would remain free ever since its final defense on August 18th. It's colonists, having endured the worst of the Automaton Occupation, were doing the best they could to try and recover all of what had been lost during those tragic months. However, the Automatons were looking to recover their lost claims, as their expansionist thirst remained ever unquenchable. As such, on October 18th, they deployed a new horrid foe in the form of The Jet Brigade, a special force of Automatons equipped with jetpacks and heavy armor, all of it based on stolen SEAF technology\nSuper Earth High Command would receive the emergency alert and immediately issued the order for all Helldivers to deploy onto Matar Bay immediately, as the Jet Brigade showed signs indicating that the Automatons knew about the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;'s existence but were now doing a brute force attempt at finding out its location.\nMatar Bay would fall on October 19th, but not after its defenders gave their lives while taking out as many Jet Brigade bots as they could with them, their heroic sacrifice causing heavy losses to the horrid Automaton strike force. The loss of these brave defenders was not in vain.\nThe enemy was ruthless, efficient, but they weren't nearly fast enough, for these heroes had already clipped their wings. And thanks to them, we defeated the Jet Brigade at Marfark, safeguarded the Democracy Space Station and sent the Automatons home packing. \nOur victory was so close, many in the Helldiver corps wish that they could have lived to see it. But they belong to Matar Bay now. \nTheir bodies and guns. Everything...except their courage. \nThat they have given to Super Earth. \nAnd with it, we can rebuild.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nAnd surely enough, Matar Bay would rebuild. After Liberty Day, Super Earth High Command would designate a series of high priority objectives that would all need urgent Helldiver intervention. Among those were the recovery of &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; and the defense against further Automaton territorial conquests, but most importantly, the Helldivers were tasked with liberating Matar Bay and capturing certain databases established by the Automatons on the planet, which High Command discovered to contain information regarding the foundries where Jet Brigade platoons are assembled. \nAs such, the Helldivers, seeking to prevent another massacre like that of Matar Bay, decided to immediately dive onto the planet, halting all other efforts towards other planet's liberation and even having to draw away all defenders from the Gellert Sector in order to expedite the liberation of the grassy martyr planet.\nFor the entirety of the first day, the Helldivers faced down the machines with all the might of Super Earth's taxpayer Super Credits, raining orbital hellfire onto the entrenched robots. However, their progress was slow and few gains were being achieved. Some in the corps began to falter, seeing how Matar Bay was taking so long to liberate and how much other objectives still needed to be done. However, fortune would smile at Liberty as usual and a massive, planetwide storm would sweep its surface, as if the planet itself was repulsed at the socialist filth polluting its pristine grasslands. \nThis strike could not have been more fortunately timed, as the Automatons at Matar Bay had also sent away a strike force to attempt another assault at Marfark, which meant that the Automaton garrison at Matar Bay was pretty much completely defenseless\nWith the Automaton forces on the planet decimated, the Helldivers would redouble their efforts; as the colonists and remaining colonial defenders of Matar Bay, spared of any suffering by the storm and still resisting against their mechanized occupiers, would join forces with the Helldivers in order to reclaim their planet home back into the righteous control of Freedom.\nMatar Bay would be swiftly recaptured, with the assault at Marfark being halted in its cracks and the martyrs buried beneath the grass having been adequately avenged.\nOperation Iron Rain.\nSince the victory in late October at Matar Bay, the often beleaguered planet would finally see some semblance of peace for the next month. It would finally begin to recover from the atrocities committed by the vile and wicked Jet Brigade. \nHowever, the Automatons revolted at the terms of peace and rebuilding. On November 28, 2184, roughly a month after the planet's liberation, the robots at neighboring &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; would send 12 battalions toward the planet to regain a foothold in the Andromeda Sector. The attack would be very sickeningly timed with &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt; being attacked a few hours earlier by the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the Major Order tasking the Helldivers with exterminating Terminids, the Automatons faced relatively little resistance at Matar Bay and regained control of the planet by the next morning.\nOperation Jetclipper.\nHowever, Matar's chance for freedom would arrive just as quickly as said freedom had been unjustly taken from them. Following a quick reorganization of the corps in the face of an assault at Marfark, the Helldivers would capitalize on the momentum of this assault, repelling it after 40 hours of defense. Then, on December 1st, the Helldivers would turn up on Matar Bay, racing to capture it as quickly as they could in order to open a pathway back into Choohe, with the purpose of liberating Choohe and securing intel regarding the factories where the Jet Brigade was being assembled.\nAfter some 16 hours of fighting, on December 2nd, the Helldivers managed to liberate Matar Bay once more, enabling the progression of the operation into Choohe."}

{"id": "4411", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4411", "title": "Meissa", "text": " is one of the five planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;. This world is covered in plant life and receives heavy rainfall and fog. At nighttime, beautiful green moonlight can be seen peeking through the fog occasionally. On April 20th, Meissa become a frontline planet. Although Meissa is a world of nature and democracy, an &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; offensive risks the planet being converted into a planet of machines and machinations. \nTopography.\nMeissa is a relatively flat world with some rocky features. The air is filled with plant debris and ash, and the planet is often very foggy. Rain is nearly constant. Large oceans and many lakes also are found here. Plant life like trees and tall grass is uniformly found everywhere. Other life forms like small flying bugs that glow red or blue are also present. &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; should be aware of the dangers of the rain and the volcanoes here. The volcanoes have the potential to create patches of fire in key areas.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System - Defense of Meissa (April 20th - April 21st).\nAutomaton forces began to assault Meissa on April 20th. This attack was part of their &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Rampart\"&gt;wider joint-offensive with the Terminids.&lt;/a&gt; So far, Helldiver forces have been too overstretched to respond in force to the attack on Meissa. There was no substantial change to this part of the front on April 21st. S.E.A.F forces were reported overrun the next day. \nDeclaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny - Liberation Campaign of Meissa (April 22nd - Middle of May 2184).\nMeissa fell into Automaton hands after the failure to defend the planet. The sudden crisis in Umlaut sector caused Helldivers to rush into east .The liberation percentage averaged at 1.05% per day. With the Automatons already having secured Charon Prime, their offensive continued to the south into &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Later, fighting would reach &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; from here. By no later than May 13th, the planet fell. The liberation campaign for Meissa was slow and drawn out, only making the nectar of inevitable victory ever more sweet. However since May 13th, only a skeleton crew of Helldivers fought on the planet, with nearly all of forces being occupied elsewhere. The liberation campaign would gradually come to an end over the next week, leaving the planet fully in automaton hands.\nOperation Valiant Resistance - Summer Liberation Campaign (June 10th. Ongoing).\nHelldiver forces returned to the planet on June 10th. These soldiers were those brave enough to continue the offensive began all the way on &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Firewall\"&gt;Operation Valiant Resistance.&lt;/a&gt; The successful operation, which concluded with the capture of &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, opened the way to Meissa's jungle surface once again. By the next day however, most of this force of ~13,000 had dissipated due to a new offensive on &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;. That offensive was the opening volley in &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Trolley%20Problem\"&gt;Operation Trolley Problem.&lt;/a&gt; The force on Meissa was miniscule until July 3rd. Liberation progress nearly reset by July 3rd. But on this day, a new defense order began to protect the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs Helldiver forces shifted to the Ymir Sector, Meissa became a target again. ~15,500 Helldivers assaulted the planet on July 3rd. By July 4th, the system was about halfway liberated. The size of the Helldiver force dropped to ~5,000 as combat began on the true objective of &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;. On July 5th, X-45 was liberated. Helldiver forces on Meissa swelled to ~10,000, bolstering reclamation efforts. \nLoss of momentum did not seem to occur following the assaults on &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;. The defense of these planets are critical to maintaining supply lines to Meissa and X-45. Around the same time of the defense of &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;, The Helldivers successfully reasserted control of Meissa, cutting off the attack on &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; and opening up FTL Lines to &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the liberation of Meissa a hastily put together force of Automatons, originating from &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, made landfall on the planet, engulfing the beautiful jungle world in war once more. This attack was barely resisted, leading to a Helldiver victory on July 6th."}

Menkent was a lightly defended system thought to be safe from the insidious plague of socialism, until a massive offensive by the Automatons struck deep into Federation space during the Reclamation.\nTopography.\nMenkent has earned a reputation as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; of the West\", both for it's geography and for its similarly volatile ecology. Dust storms makes visibility beyond a few hundred meters near impossible, whilst the intense heat and fire tornadoes of the planet have taken their toll on SEAF forces. Fortunately whilst the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; metal frames might have trouble burning, their internal CPU's, wires and heat sinks of the machines are just as vulnerable... at least when it comes to the less armored machines.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nFollowing a massive offensive by the Automatons into Federation space on April 9th, Menkent became a contested front line world. Menkent and &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; would be where SEAF Engineers would build orbital defences as part of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;, key to defending &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; itself and the core worlds of the Federation from direct assault.\nAlthough the campaign to take the planet would be brutal with over 45 million casualties, it would none the less be successfully liberated from the Automatons mechanical hands... for about 24 hours as during the liberation of Lesath, the Automatons would counterattack the planet, necessitating a second deployment to the planet. Many &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; cursed toasters everywhere. Menkent was secured for the second time later that day in mere hours, letting the SEAF engineers resume their work.\nWith the Automaton advance arrested, rudimentary orbital defenses were established on Menkent and &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, which were then augmented by hardworking SEAF and civilian laborers. Meanwhile, a SEAF Forward Command Base was established on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, providing fresh recruits and supplies to the front.\nOperation Legitimate Undertaking.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; breach however the automaton fleet would bypass Menkent and attack the SEAF Forward Command Base on Vernen Wells, knocking out communications and cutting Menkent off from the rest of federation space, with Menkent being attacked the following day, alongside &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a valiant defense effort, the Super Earth Armed Forces were still reeling and unable to effectively launch a counter attack, with Menkent becoming yet another planet that fell to the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; during that infamous week.\nMenkent would return to the forefront of the galactic war following the liberation of Vernen Wells, as on April 26th High Command announced the start of Operation Legitimate Undertaking, the first phase of which was to liberate the planets of &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;. Both planets were vital to the galactic war effort, however high command acknowledged that only one planet (and its citizens) could be liberated in a timely order.\nThe first step was to liberate Menkent and Lesath in order to open up FTL lanes to Choohe and Penta respectfully. The majority of the Helldivers attention would be focused on &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt;, with Menkent becoming a second front on the way to Choohe. Even so SEAF forces would make good progress towards liberating the planet, especially after more Helldivers were deployed on the planet following Penta's liberation, however the majority of forces would be focused towards &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;, due to the harsh topography of Menkent."}

Its general terrain consisted of vast ponds and heavily forested areas.\nAs one of the Barrier Planets, Meridia was subject to the mass dispensing of Termicide by the Terminid Control System. The massive TCS was designed to permanently prevent the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;fascist bugs&lt;/a&gt; to the Umlaut Sector. However, on the 29th of April, the unthinkable happened. A preliminary investigation by the Ministry of Science revealed that some terminids were exposed to non-lethal doses of Termicide, causing mutations that allowed them to resist the effects of the termicide. On Meridia specifically, the terminids also gained the ability to reproduce much more rapidly, with this effect only being exacerbated with continuous exposure to the Termicide. These mutations caused the planet to be overwhelmed in just mere hours, turning it into a &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; nearly comparable with the Terminid home planet. \nHigh Command had deemed the planet a lost cause until Operation Enduring Peace began, with the aim of destroying Meridia with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;. On the 2nd of June, 2184, Meridia was successfully collapsed into a &lt;a href=\"Biomes\"&gt;black hole&lt;/a&gt;. On the 24th of December, 2184, it was confirmed that the black hole was instead a &lt;a href=\"Biomes\"&gt;wormhole&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nPreviously, Meridia was populated by dense jungle vegetation. Federation scientists were able to categorized a number of tropical tree and plant species native to the planet. Deep, warm oceans bordered the edges of Meridia's continental landmass, which was contiguous around the planet. Citizens were warned not to approach any of the multiple active volcanoes sighted near inhabited zones. \nBut after the failure of the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;, the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt; turned Meridia into a &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, the likes of which had never been seen before...\nTopography after the TCS Failure.\nThe topography and ecology of Meridia was changed drastically after the loss of the planet on the April 29th, following the failure of the TCS Towers. Orbital observations by the Super Earth Navy confirmed that Meridia had been transformed from a lush, blue and green jungle world to a gigantic, undemocractic insect hive. The atmosphere and oceans became a sickly brown, filled with a mix of termicide and mutated &lt;a href=\"Spore%20Spewer\"&gt;terminid spores&lt;/a&gt;. The bugs bred like rats, choking the life out of most other fauna and flora on the surface.\nThe Ministry of Science concluded that Meridia had undergone a process of proto-terraforming (or Termaforming) that effectively turned the entire planet into one gargantuan nest, dubbed a \"Terminid Super Colony\". The terrain now consisted of dead indigenous plant life interspersed with vast terminid mound and hive structures, including 'forests' of &lt;a href=\"Spore%20Spewer\"&gt;spore spewers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrieker%20Nest\"&gt;shrieker nests&lt;/a&gt;. Meridia's numerous active volcanoes were the only remnants of the planet left untouched by the bugs.\nThe implications, as fascinating as they are, have been horrifying for the scientific community. Meridia stands as stark proof that the Terminids can essentially, and probably irreversibly, DESTROY the environments of planets. Prior to its destruction, Meridia stood as a monument to scientific hubris as the only &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;. We can only pray now that this once beautiful world will be the exception, rather than the rule going forward.\nTopography after Operation Enduring Peace.\nAfter Meridia became a Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers were left with no choice but to collapse it into a singularity using &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Immense gravitational forces so strong that everything, including light, is dragged inward, resulting in reduced visibility beyond the event horizon. High-energy radiation of X-rays and gamma rays emitted as matter accelerates and speeds up heat buildup to such a degree that everything is annihilated in a brilliant (yet dangerous) display of energetic particles.\nSuper Destroyers returning to where Meridia once was following Operation Enduring Peace have found that the only thing that remains of the planet is a beautiful, purple black hole. All celestial bodies that were once in the system are now gone, having been consumed by the massive void. Helldivers have also reported strange, disconcerting noises emanating from the black hole while in orbit, but Super Earth High Command has dismissed these reports, asking Helldivers to divert their attention to more productive purposes such as liberation campaigns, or major orders.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations prior to the Second Galactic War.\nInstallation of the TCS System.\nDuring the months of February and March, the Helldivers valiantly dropped onto Meridia (along with its neighboring planets in the Umlaut Sector) to install the infrastructure necessary for the deployment of the Terminid Control System (TCS). These campaigns were quick and successful, allowing for subsequent pushes into the Draco and Mirin Sectors and establishing a definitive frontline against the Terminids.\nFailure of the TCS System.\nDue to a completely unprecedented process known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis\"&gt;hormesis&lt;/a&gt;, Terminids exposed to non-lethal doses of Termicide eventually developed genetic adaptations to the neurotoxin. The first sprouts of these mutations appeared in March, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Shrieker\"&gt;Shriekers&lt;/a&gt;, fascist flying abominations that preyed upon Super Earth's noble colonists. However, the existence of Shriekers themselves would not be enough of a concern, especially because they appeared around the time that the battles for Malevelon Creek and the rest of the Xzar and Severin Sectors were ongoing in the automaton front.\nThe real disaster occured in April 29th 2184, when continuous exposure to non-lethal doses of Termicide caused the Terminids on Meridia to develop a hyper-reproductive adapation to it. Before Helldivers could be scrambled, Meridia had been completely overwhelmed, becoming a Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;. With the rest of the planets in the Umlaut Sector at risk of suffering the same tragic fate, the Helldivers were quickly and successfully dispatched to deactivate the rest of the TCS System.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; would like to hereby request one minute of silence in commemoration to all the lost colonists of Meridia, as well as to inform the readers that the traitorous scientists responsible for the defect in the TCS System have been thoroughly and meticulously investigated, trialed and executed.\nSecond Galactic War.\nUp until Operation Emancipator.\nBoth prior and after the declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny, the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; at Meridia had been causing immense trouble. Nearby systems suffered from regular Terminid outbreaks caused by abnormally high levels of spore production from the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; both seeing three consecutive bug incursions prior to Operation Freedom's Calling. Within the Umlaut Sector, other planets such as &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; frequently had to be re-liberated by the valiant Super Earth Armed Forces.\nWhile the Helldivers were occupied liberating the Petafactory in &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; at Meridia would be responsible for causing yet another outbreak at Angel's Venture. While the Helldivers, in a display of their usually impeccable military prowess, managed to defend &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; and liberate &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, this siege was most likely the last straw for Super Earth High Command in regards to the question of the Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony's&lt;/a&gt; fate.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nEventually agreeing that simply nuking the planet from orbit wasn't thorough enough (as by now the Terminids had burrowed deep into Meridia's crust), Super Earth High Command authorized the weaponization of the exotic &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;, liberated from the tentacles of the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Fluid was designed to destroy the Meridia &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; by injecting massive amounts of the fluid into the planet's crust, which would eventually cause the planet to collapse in on itself. However, in order to use this newly developed weapon on Meridia, a path had to be cleared there first.\nThus High Command authorized &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%2520Enduring%2520Peace\"&gt;Operation Enduring Peace&lt;/a&gt;, the first phase of which was to secure a route to &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and to hold the staging ground until sufficient quantities of Dark Fluid could be weaponized and deployed. Such was the priority of this operation that all other territorial losses were considered acceptable to ensure its success.\nOn the morning of May 30, 2184, with Phase 1 of the operation completed, Super Earth High Command gave the final order: Helldivers were to initiate the deployment of the Dark Fluid, which was to be delivered in backpacks that would be then loaded and drilled into the planet's surface. Once a critical mass was reached, the Dark Fluid would accrete into a superdense mass, triggering total planetary implosion of the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; and utterly annihilating its hyper-reproductive Terminids.\nHowever progress would be slow during the first two days of the operation, with Helldivers reporting a level of resistance that had never been witnessed before. The Terminids had managed to reach a 10% level of planet-wide resistance to liberation, which meant that any and all progress was almost immediately undone by the unyielding plague. The assault on the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; also appeared to have spurred an increase in Terminid outbreaks on other planets, with scientists likening this response to a kicked hornet's nest, from the beloved childhood pastime.\nNot only that, but many Helldivers also reported bug breaches directly beneath the Tectonic Drill used to deploy the Dark Fluid on Meridia, hindering operations significantly. Fortunately, on the second day of the operation, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; was able to engineer upgrades to the drill so that they now propagated anti-fascist ultrasonic frequencies through the ground, preventing Terminid breaches in its immediate vicinity. Determination and bravery allowed the Helldivers to make a dent in the Terminids' numbers, reducing the level of planet-wide resistance from 10% down to ~5.5%, creating much needed breathing room to deploy the Dark Fluid into the planet's crust. \nTo make matters worse, Helldivers also reported a seemingly infinite number of shriekers rising out of the ground on Meridia after deploying the Dark Fluid, even after dealing with all visible shrieker nests. Reports detailed swarms big enough to block out portions of the sky, making extraction significantly more difficult for unprepared squads who were unable to deal with the fascist \"cloud\" of shriekers bearing down on them.\nDestruction of Meridia.\nAs the sun rose for the last time on Meridia, sensors on the orbiting fleet detected a decrease in Terminid spawning on the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh's&lt;/a&gt; scientists identified this as evidence of early Dark Fluid accretion stages: micro-bubbles had began to form beneath the planet's crust, disrupting Terminid hives. With tectonic integrity beginning to decrease in the final hours of the operation, the future of the Liberty teetered on the abyss. One final push was all that remained...\nThen, at 15:25 SEST, on June 2nd, 2184, Meridia became the first planet to be destroyed by use of Dark Fluid. All Super Destroyers in orbit received the order to make an emergency FTL jump to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. A gravitational disturbance was confirmed in the Meridia system, with the planet, its sun, and every other celestial body in its solar system soon disappearing from the face of the galaxy.\nSuper Destroyers returning to where Meridia once was found that the only thing that remained of the planet was a beautiful, purple &lt;a href=\"Biomes%23Black%20Hole\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;. Disturbing, strange noises fill the space surrounding Meridia. The destruction of the system marked the end of Operation Enduring Peace, which was an overwhelming success for Super Earth.\nThe destruction of Meridia did come not a moment too soon. The Meridia black hole continues to draw in every &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; spore within several billion kilometers, causing interstellar spore levels to sharply decrease in every nearby system. Though the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; continue their rampant spread across the galaxy, without the accelerating effect of the &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;, containment is now once again possible.\nThe destruction of an entire planet is a tragedy, but the tyrannical Terminids left Super Earth without any other choice. Only the honorable sacrifices of countless Helldivers prevented the bug menace from spreading even further. A Victory Fund has been initiated to support the few remaining Meridian-born Helldivers during their future battles.\nOn December 2nd, 2184, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; concluded all reports on Meridia, all evidence suggesting Meridia is nothing more than an ordinary black hole.\nReturn of the Illuminate.\nAny pretenses that the illuminate would return through the Meridia black hole were thoroughly dissuaded following the battle of &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, as the Squ'ith actually appeared out of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Front\"&gt;galactic south&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the completely normal Meridia black hole. However following repeated battles with the Squ'ith (and likely perpetuated by battle fatigue) a new theory emerged that the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; that federation faced was in fact a \u201cvanguard\u201d force, paving the way for the main invasion fleet.On the 19th of December, 2184, Helldivers started noticing novel electromagnetic phenomena in vicinity of the Meridian Black Hole. High Command was of course well aware of the situation and closely monitoring it with experts in the field. However some Helldivers pilgrimaging to Meridia soon discovered that the black hole had changed, it's purple hues now more pronounced.\nMany Helldivers also noted that the Illuminate seem to be moving towards Meridia, reinforcing the belief that the squids are heading to the black hole -- gathering colonists from the populous galactic south along the way. High Command has yet to Comment on this development (partially due to The Ministry of Defense's strategists and analysts being under review following the &lt;a href=\"New%20Stockholm\"&gt;New Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; debacle) though High Command is aware of the situation, which is being closely monitored by experts in the field. Helldivers are advised to avoid distractions and focus their full attention on repelling the Illuminate threat.\nFollowing the conclusion of Operation Squid Game however, Astronomers have reported novel anomalous phenomena in the form of fluctuations in the event horizon and electromagnetic flares in the vicinity of the Meridian Singularity. Since the exotic substance known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt; was found on Illuminate worlds at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; and was used to collapse the planet into a black hole, High Command concluded that the recent changes to the Meridian Singularity, so shortly following the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt;, may indicate a deeper connection. Indeed the Meridian Singularity may be no ordinary black hole, as many leading government experts have long suspected.\nNaturally these developments demanded further investigation. High Command thus ordered the construction of a new Center of Science on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;. However the Helldivers first had to clear the planet and nearby area of any &lt;a href=\"Terminid\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; infestation in order to facilitate its safe construction. Thanks to decisive Fascism-repulsion operations by the Helldivers in vicinity of Fenrir III, the construction of a new Center of Science was completed safely. Top &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics\"&gt;astrophysicists&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; immediately convened there to closely study the Meridian Singularity and instantly the project yielded valuable insights.\nThe Singularity was not, as many uninformed laypeople had assumed, a typical black hole. It is, in fact, the first observed instance of a wormhole: a tunnel in spacetime connecting two disparate points in space. Much more remains to be investigated as it is likely that the wormhole was formed following the implosion of Meridia by dark matter unclear if the wormhole formed recently, or if it has existed for some time already. A connection to the recent &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; attacks is one of many threads being pursued."}

Mines can also be set off by corpses of enemies; this sometimes results in a single enemy triggering multiple mines. Mines can also be set off by direct fire.\nFollowing the initial drop and scattering action, minefields do not draw further aggression from enemies. However, enemies will respond to the sound of any mines detonating near them, possibly attracting the entirety of an undemocratic patrol.

It acts as the federation's primary intelligence agency, responsible for the collection, analysis, and exploitation of information in support of law enforcement, galactic security and military operations. The primary role of the Ministry is to collect, analyze, and distribute intelligence as required by the federation.\nIt's means of information gathering can be both overt and covert and may include espionage, communication interception, cryptanalysis, evaluation of public sources and cooperation with other institutions, such as the Super Earth Armed forces and the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably it is part of a wider Super Earth Intelligence Community, working alongside the likes of the Ministry of &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. However in all likelihood the Ministry of Intelligence is primarily concerned with enemies outside of the federation; most prominently the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, their interrogators have managed to successfully extracted information from captured bots, by uploading captured hard-drives to bot husks in &lt;a href=\"SEAF\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt; possession and exposing them to Unpleasant Sensory Experience Simulations.\nThe Ministry also maintains a fleet of \"Security\" Surveillance Satellites, one of which was instrumental in discovering the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; \"Petafactory\" on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;, allowing SEAF forces to capture the planet before it could become fully operational and modify it into a second Morgunson Arsenal, allowing the construction of a new dual-autocannon Exosuit variant: the &lt;a href=\"EXO-49%20Emancipator%20Exosuit\"&gt;EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperations.\nSwift Disassembly and the Reclamation.\nThe most recent success and failure of the ministry is the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;\"\"\"The Reclamation\"&lt;/a&gt; through the use of the above mentioned methods, which was then correctly identified as a massive invasion of unprecedented scale. They were also able to identified a long-range communications array deep in Automation space on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;. Following the arrays capture, analysts were able to determine that the bots were broadcasting outside the Galactic Frontier, however the analysts were unable to learn more due to the deletion of most of the data. Never the less they were able to identify blueprints for automaton &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;aerial gunships&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the hardworking factory laborers of Super Earth to accelerate production of anti-air weapons.\nFollowing the success of Operation Swift Disassembly, it was assumed that all any threat from the Automaton's and their \"Reclamation\" had passed. Out of an abundance of caution, SEAF teams were dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt; to search what remains of Automaton facilities and servers for any additional intelligence. Unfortunately super earth's analysts were unable to discover the existence of the Automaton's main fleet, or their plans for a surprise invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lacaille%20Sector\"&gt;Lacaille Sector&lt;/a&gt; until they launched their invasion several days later... a black mark on the Ministry's record if there ever was one...\nDatabase One.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;' ultimate objective is all too clear (the utter destruction of our way of life as their rigid programming cannot tolerate our unbridled Freedom), many gaps remain in our military intelligence regarding the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. The originating location of the Invasion Fleet is yet unknown and the socialist toasters focus on &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; remains unexplained, save for wild speculation.\nThat changed with the discovery of the large &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; Data Center on the planet of &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, designated Database One. It's vast stores of data could answer many questions, although remote hacking was impossible due to being protected by exceptionally robust encryption protocols, though this also meant that whatever data was stored there was clearly important, given how much effort had been expended to keep it hidden.\nTo this end SEAF High Command lunched Operation: Valiant Resistance. After three days the Helldivers were able to liberate the planet and capture Database One intact, which allowed for intrepid SEAF Cyberwarfare Specialists to manually extract the data and breach it's encryption. Although it will take months to sift through the truly monumental amount of data recovered, several key discoveries have already been made.\nChief amongst these was that the Automatons appear to be planning some sort of massive terraforming project on &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; itself. Additionally decoded data includes detailed recordings of the impact of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; Supercolony on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Other keywords are also referenced numerous times throughout the data trove, though without additional details: Vessel 00, Nucleus, The Final Collective, and others.\nAs the SEAF and Helldiver Corps push towards Cyberstan, our analysts continue to decode the vast database, so that new intel may be gleaned that will aid in our resistance.\nOperation Jet Clipper.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Automatons%23Jet%2520Brigade\"&gt;Jet Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and it's campaign of terror, where homesteads were pillaged and citizens were murdered, is long over, the threat of further despoiling remains. Though the Jet Brigade was summarily routed by the Helldivers during Operation Balance of Liberty, the factories that produced them were still out there, ready to spew out more gravity-defiling calculators-at-arms. Fortunately decryption of Automaton database intel revealed that the Jet Brigade used &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; as a staging ground. Liberating this staging ground would likely reveal information on the Jet Brigade factories.\nUnfortunately Choohe was liberated behind schedule, with whatever secrets about the Jet Brigade it may have contained been scrubbed from servers and databases. Fortunately not all was not as an impressive number of memory drives were recovered from the dismantled Automatons. High Command had also ordered the dismantling of any remaining Automatons that operated alongside the Jet Brigade and may still have important data stored on their internal drives. Thanks to the swift actions of the Helldiver Corps, such drives were not in short supply, with the chance of finding useful intel a statistical inevitability.\nAs soon as their contents have been uploaded to bot husks in SEAF possession, they will be ready for interrogation. This is all but guaranteed to yield results, as soon as all 89,601,000 drives have been thoroughly interrogated."}

It presumably fills the need for both civil and military scientific research and development, relying on the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; to obtain samples on which to perform experiments on.\nThe Ministry of Science is also responsible for developing and funding certain experimental infrastructure projects, such as the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;, the Terminid Research Initiative, development for Termicide 1.0 and 2.0, and for developing ways to deploy the mysterious Dark Fluid.\nMoradesh Project.\nScientists on &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; were the ones responsible for developing a way to combat the Meridia Supercolony. With the hope being that the \"Super weapon\" developed would be Liberty's salvation. The details of this project remained highly classified, with the only guarantee being that the Ministry of Science's best minds worked hard to bring this secret weapon to fruition and that it would involve the use of exotic &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dark Fluid is a form of synthesized exotic matter liberated from the following the First Galactic War. In a scientific breakthrough following the opening of a micro-blackhole in the research facility on Moradesh (speaghettifying twelve facility staff before fizzling out), our scientists had just engineered a solution to the Terminid Supercolony on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe project would be an unadulterated success as at 15:25 SEST, on June 2nd, 2184, Meridia became the first system to be destroyed by use of Dark Fluid. All &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; in orbit received the order to make an emergency FTL jump to Super Earth or the nearby &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; system. A gravitational disturbance was confirmed in the Meridia system, with the planet of Meridia, it's sun and every other celestial body in its solar system soon disappearing from the face of the galaxy as a beautiful purple black hole appeared in place of the Supercolony.\nNot long after the Moradesh Research Facility was decommissioned following the total exhaustion of all Dark Fluid stores. The tireless scientists who contributed to the \"Moradesh Project\" were all awarded the Super Citizenship Medal of Freedom.\nTerminid Research Initiative.\nIn order to better predict certain previous unforeseeable outcomes when dealing with the Terminids, the Ministry of Science has begun a &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; Research Initiative.\n&lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; evolution is known to accelerate under duress. Therefore, in order to observe potential outcomes, applying controlled duress to the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; will be necessary to scientific progress. Thus the Helldivers were ordered to kill over one hundred million &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; -- which was accomplished in a little over eight hours. Sure enough, this aided the work of Super Earth's scientists considerably, both thanks the efficacious bug-eradication methodologies as well as behavior observed in the field.\nOne key ancillary finding was that &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; produce higher quality E-710 when harvested under extreme duress. This finding will guide future E-710 acquisition policy, assuring our access to uninterrupted FTL travel capabilities. Additionally close observation of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; did uncover a new behavior: the construction of spore-producing towers, roughly the size of small skyscrapers.\nWhilst the Ministry of Science has deemed that this new behavior to be harmless, it will be closely monitored just in case. In any case, the Terminid Research initiative was continued into Operation Glorious Xenocide where Helldivers demonstrated a commitment to scientific progress equaled only by their fervor for Democratic supremacy. Thanks to their efforts, the Ministry of Science was able to gather even more data to further ongoing Terminid research efforts.\nWhile no clear method of termination has proved to produce more E-710 than any other, the Ministry of Science's top researchers all agreed that establishing this beyond doubt was well worth the expenditure. However, with the large quantities of data gathered, one new finding did emerge: Terminid mutations, rather than appearing randomly as previously hypothesized actually decreased in frequency as proximity to Super Earth increased. Indeed it now appears that genetic variants are perpetuating from deep within Terminid space. The explanation for this new phenomenon is yet unknown, and more investigation is necessary."}

This ministry is responsible for providing information based on facts and democratic values to the public, serving as the main source of truthful propaganda for the Federation through all of the channels it possesses control over, from the Galactic Wide Web to the many possible bandwidths of interstellar transmissions. All posters speaking about the other Ministries and the rest of the Federation at large are created and distributed by the Ministry of Truth in order to give the most accurate and factual information possible to their citizens, in order to deter any and all treasonous dissident thoughts.\nBy and large, the Ministry of Truth is responsible for the dissemination of news and war reports. As reported by the Ministry, their reporting and evaluations have an accuracy rating of 100%. Any evidence to the contrary, or &lt;a href=\"Terminate%20Illegal%20Broadcast\"&gt;news garnered from outside official channels&lt;/a&gt;, is dissident propaganda and should be reported to the nearest Loyalty or Democracy Officer.\nAttached Agencies and Officers.\nDemocracy Officers.\nThe Ministry of Truth is the Ministry which every &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Officer\"&gt;Democracy Officer&lt;/a&gt; reports to, with their role being to motivate Helldivers and other SEAF personnel to fight for Managed Democracy and \"optimize their Citizenship\". Judging by their appearance, the Democracy Officers appear to be seasoned combat veterans, employed by the Ministry of Truth to dispense inspirational quotes for the troops as well as update them on the war effort. It can be assumed that they also merit out corporal punishment (including execution or relocation to a freedom camp) should they find any dissident activity (such as deserting). \nThe Democracy Officers are not to be confused with the Loyalty Officers; these are mentioned by the &lt;a href=\"Service%20Technician\"&gt;Service Technician&lt;/a&gt; and the Super Destroyer announcements, which encourage Citizens to report any dissident activity to their \"local Loyalty Officer\". Judging by their role as active police who quell internal threats to the Federation's security, it would seem the Loyalty Officers instead belong to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Ministry of Unity&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrohmann News.\nThe Ministry of Truth is also in charge of supervising Super Earth's largest news channel \"Strohmann News\" which Helldivers are able to watch aboard their Super Destroyers. Strohmann News uses the same logo as the Ministry.\nTruth Enforcers.\nWith the addition of the \"Truth Enforcers\" warbond, an organization called the \"Truth Enforcers\" was introduced. Judging by the two available uniforms, the UF-50 Bloodhound and the UF-16 Inspector, the \"Truth Enforcers\" possibly serve the role of a politically-aligned paramilitary component of the Ministry of Truth or the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Ministry of Unity&lt;/a&gt; akin to the role filled by the \"Waffen-SS\" in Germany during World War 2 or the Sith Troopers from \"Star Wars\", the latter appearing to be a clear inspiration for the UF-50 Bloodhound Armor.\nGiven the nature of the equipment found in the Warbond, the \"Truth Enforcers\" can be assumed to be tasked with eliminating any dissidents (as designated by the Ministry of Truth) that reside both among the military corps and the civilian population, with the UF-16 Inspector Armor possibly being a glimpse at the officer's attire of a member of this organization, while the UF-50 Bloodhound armor serves as the core infantry of this organization, embedded within the ranks of the Helldiver Corps.\nAccording to the description of the \"Pride of the Whistleblower\" cape, The Truth Enforcers have an award called the \"Informant of the Month\", which awards the recipient a cape called \"Pride of the Whistleblower\". The name of this cape, and the nature of its implied affiliations also indicate that this organization carries out infiltration and espionage tasks, as well as (possibly) extrajudicial executions of dissidents.\nAccording to the UF-16 Inspector Armor, the Truth Enforcers also have a series of famous mystery novels named after them \"Truth Enforcers: Enforcers of Truth\", much like how the exploits of the Viper Commandos were portrayed in the classic comic book series \"Tales of the Viper Commandos.\" The armor calls to mind those paragons of patriotism who protect us from treasonous lies.\nDemocratic Investigation Agency.\nIt is highly possible that the Democratic Investigation Agency serves the role of an \"Inquisition\" within Super Earth and, therefore, reports back to the Ministry of Truth or the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Ministry of Unity&lt;/a&gt;, behaving much like a secret police."}

Having been spared the horrors of the First Galactic War, this planet didn't see much colonization efforts due to its remoteness and the apparent lack of resources, which allowed Mintoria a relative peace that other planet colonies could not have.\nBut if there is something that the Automatons are simply built to hate...it is peace.\nBy October 2184, Mintoria had been disconnected from the ongoing galactic war since the very start, much like the rest of the Gellert Sector. Its remoteness and lack of colonists meant that finding itself detached from the FTL Network back in April, when the nearby Valdis sector fell, was just as unimportant and commonplace as the color of the grass on the planet.\nHowever, in late October 2184, the Automatons would make an advance towards the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Colonists on Mintoria and its' sister planet &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; would watch in horror as bordering &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yed%20Prior\"&gt;Yed Prior&lt;/a&gt; would fall to the robots in the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The colonists' worst fears would be confirmed as their peaceful lives would be shattered on October 28th when the Automatons would invade both Mintoria and Blistica simultaneously, with the robots on Zefia attacking Mintoria. Due to the then-Major Order pushing the Helldivers to liberate &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as well as efforts to liberate &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;, both planets would show no resistance to the Automatons and would be easily captured by the next day.\nOperation Iron Rain.\nAs both Mintoria and Blistica would be located on the galactic fringe of the galaxy, both planets would see little to no liberation attempts for the next month. This would prove to be costly, as in the early morning hours of November 25th, the Automatons from both planets would send a combined force of 16 Battalions toward their northern neighbor, &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt;. Zzaniah would be attacked at the same time that the Terminids launched a massive assault on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, few Helldivers would answer the call to defend Zzaniah, and it would fall by the early morning of November 27th. This defeat would cut off Super Earth from any supply lines towards either Mintoria or Blistica, leaving both planets under the full, despotic control of the Automatons.\nOperation Crop Dust.\nOn December 5th, 2184, orders were given to liberate Mintoria, along with &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are locked behind enemy lines. Such mentioned planets have been identified as being rich in salt-mines, which is needed in order to rectify the shortage of chlorine and finally commence the production of MD-8 Gas Mines and its requisition to all Super Destroyers. However, Mintoria, along with Blistica, are not accessible due to &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt; being under Automaton control. The Helldivers are currently working to liberate Zzaniah Prime and re-open the floodgates to both Mintoria and Blistica, which will finally enable them to be liberated. The colonists trapped on both planets wait eagerly.\nMintoria had essentially been abandoned by the Automatons, with no shipments of supplies reaching the planet and leaving its resistance rate against liberation at zero. As such, once Esker was liberated on December 8th, the Helldivers immediately moved all available manpower to Mintoria, as the alloted time for the operation was running short. Mintoria was liberated by the end of the day, allowing the Helldivers to relocate to Blistica, which showed unusual difficulty despite its light resistance rate."}

Having been colonized at some point after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, Mog's history hadn't been very notable or outstanding in any way. Given its arctic climate and its propensity for blizzards, Mog's path to wealth and prosperity probably came mostly from a its advantageous location right between the &lt;a href=\"Rictus%20Sector\"&gt;Rictus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gallux%20Sector\"&gt;Gallux&lt;/a&gt; sectors making it a valuable spaceport, as it could be connected to at least 6 planets throughout 3 sectors.\nHowever, the autocratic , putrid and corroded due to their outdated mysticism, could not tolerate such abundance laying in another species' hands. Mere hours after being defeated at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;, the Squids would make a second attempt at an offensive, attacking the underdefended &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Prime\"&gt;Genesis Prime&lt;/a&gt; with hopes of collapsing its defenses within 12 hours, then followed up with a secondary parallel assault at Mog. However, they did not count with the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; and their righteous might who, having rebuked the Illuminate once, were already planning to repeat their feat a second time. \nSupposedly, many SEAF personnel and novice &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; have referred to this attack as \"being mogged,\" which was a slang from the pre &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; generation Alpha (From 2012-2024). Unfortunately, the meaning has been lost in the digital archives. \nAfter taking the planet, the quickly retreated from Mog, and started an offensive on &lt;a href=\"Bellatrix\"&gt;Bellatrix&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the planet in ruins and its rightful resources stolen."}

The Automatons grow in power as well, continuing their unjust invasion. &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth's&lt;/a&gt; analysts are certain that nothing could have forestalled this dire situation, save perhaps the timely employment of &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nScientists on &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; are making progress on a way to combat the Meridia Supercolony. With the hope being that this \"Super weapon\" will be Liberty's salvation. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science's&lt;/a&gt; (second) best minds are working hard to weaponize a highly classified, experimental substance known as Dark Fluid and in an (accidental) scientific breakthrough, may have found a way to engineer a solution to the Terminid Supercolony on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn what officials have described a \"Close Call\", the volatile exotic materials suddenly collapsed into a micro-black hole that speaghetti-fied 12 facility members and forcing an emergency shutdown of the facility before the micro-black hole thankfully evaporated. As of writing production of weaponized dark fluid is scheduled to resume tomorrow, with no shortfalls in support of the ongoing operation to destroy the terminid supercolony.\nThe Moradesh Project.\nOn the morning of May 30, 2184, with phase 1 of Operation Enduring Peace was completed, beginning Phase two: Helldivers were to initiate the deployment of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;, which was to be delivered in backpacks that would be then loaded and drilled into the planet's surface. Once a critical mass is reached, the Dark Fluid will accrete into a superdense mass, triggering total planetary implosion with the Supercolony and its hyper-reproductive Terminids being spaghettified.\nMeanwhile Technicians at the &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; Research Facility were working nonstop to convert raw Dark Fluid into weaponized payloads for this operation. However this high output can't be maintained for long, even with safety and sleep protocols optimized for productivity; thus speed was critical in this operation.\nAs the sun rose for the last time on Meridia, sensors on the orbiting fleet detected a decrease in Terminid spawning on the Supercolony. &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh's&lt;/a&gt; scientists were then able identified this as evidence of early Dark Fluid accretion stages: micro-bubbles began to form beneath the planet's crust, disrupting Terminid hives. With the tectonic integrity beginning to decrease in the final hours of the operation\nThen, at 15:25 SEST, on June 2nd, 2184, Meridia became the first system to be destroyed by use of Dark Fluid. All Super Destroyers in orbit received the order to make an emergency FTL jump to Super Earth. A gravitational disturbance was confirmed in the Meridia system, with the planet of Meridia, it's sun and every other celestial body in the solar system soon disappearing from the face of the galaxy as a beautiful purple black hole appeared in place of the Supercolony.\nNot long after the &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; Research Facility was decommissioned following the total exhaustion of all Dark Fluid stores. The tireless scientists who contributed to the \"&lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; Project\" have all been awarded the Super Citizenship Medal of Freedom."}

It has little to no flora, with only small patches of sparse grey grass and plants, with some occasionaly having purple flowers. It is covered in a persistent light gray fog.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nNivel 43's distance from &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; and non-strategic position kept it under frequent tyranny of the despotic &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;. After the unexpected failure of the Terminid Control System on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, the tide of fascist insectoids overtook Nivel 43 along with the entire Mirin Sector.\nSecond Galactic War.\nThe judicious destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; supercolony on May 30, 2184 allowed the SEAF to push forward into Terminid-occupied territory. \nOperation Hive Breaker.\nShortly after multiple overwhelming victories on the Automaton Front, the Helldivers were directed to liberate five planets illegally occupied by the Terminids: &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, and Nivel 43. Though Nivel 43's location meant it would be liberated last, it had not been forgotten. Despite the Terminids' sloppy attempts to slow down the SEAF through outbreaks on &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;, Nivel 43 was finally liberated on June 21, 2184.\nFalstaff and Jin Xi Lockdown.\nHowever, Nivel 43, ignored as usual, would fall to a Terminid assault on June 25th, as the Helldivers were occupied with the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;. It would be stuck on a deadlock since then, as the Helldivers then began racing to secure the following key planets in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; Sectors.\nHowever, despite this victory, Nivel 43's Terminid Hives managed to shield themselves from democracy, as they would launch another dual barrage of intergalactic spores onto both Hellmire and Esker, while Estanu would be under attack from a Terminid spore barrage coming from Fori Prime, which inevitably would create a triple defense situation that succesfully locked Nivel 43 away from the Helldivers' reach...for now.\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation.\nWith their position secured, the Terminids at Nivel 43 mostly stood by as their spawns on Esker went on to launch a massive superonslaught onto &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; on August 6th. In their devious machinations, the Bugs at Nivel 43 would send an assault onto Erson Sands on August 7th by creating a new FTL line, which forced the Helldivers to abandon it in order to concentrate on the defense of Socorro.\nWith Erson Sands taken, the bugs were able to conduct the next part of their plan. Originating around &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt;, a massive cloud of intergalactic Terminid spores had begun engulfing the planets in the L'estrade Sector that were under Terminid control. And soon enough, it began to expand onto other neighboring planets that were controlled by the Bugs, with Erson Sands and Nivel 43 being engulfed and SEAF Satellites being unable to monitor the situation on these 2 planets any further.\nThe situation on Nivel 43 is now unknown."}

The bugs tried hard, and got so far as to overwhelm the defenses at Cirrus, but in the end, their vain attempts wouldn't even matter, as a day later, the Helldivers heroically destroyed the Meridian &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Enduring Peace, immediately collapsing their offensive in Cirrus and allowing the &lt;a href=\"Celeste%20Sector\"&gt;Celeste Sector&lt;/a&gt; to breath a sigh of relief."}

At times you need to load a magazine of Liberty and cast your votes in the battlefield around you. But like voting for the 2nd party, a wasted bullet wastes our precious Managed Democracy. Just as on Super Earth that you are defending, your elected officials will let you how to best cast your vote with each mission.\"\nIn any given mission, a random selection of Objectives are assigned. Primary objectives must be completed, though secondary objectives can be failed and/or missed; failing an objective reduces XP and Requisition gained accordingly.\nAs with &lt;a href=\"Stratagems\"&gt;Stratagem&lt;/a&gt; Beacons, an active or threatened objective tends to draw a great deal of attention from enemy patrols. Whilst the degree varies from objective to objective, caution should be exercised. Prepare defenses before activating ICBM launch sites or Geological Surveys, and be ready to fend off incoming enemies!\nLocating Objectives.\nSome objective types may require you to search an area to locate them, with the size of the area varying from mission to mission, though they appear as blinking question marks '?' in your map once you are in close proximity to them. With the &lt;a href=\"Boosters\"&gt;UAV Recon Booster&lt;/a&gt;, this range is much larger and can be seen further away.\nThere are two other ways to locate hidden objectives without these: \nExtraction.\n\"These objectives are Mission Critical. Helldivers only move forward to victory, we will not retreat even against overwhelming firepower, superior numbers, or unfavorable weather conditions. As such, extraction only becomes available once victory is secured.\"\nSee &lt;a href=\"Extraction\"&gt;Extraction&lt;/a&gt; for in-depth details.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTactical Objectives.\nTactical Objectives are optional objectives that can be found during active missions. The amount of Tactical Objectives that spawn during a mission depends on the difficulty, having up to 5 appear at maximum. While completely optional, these objectives hold effects that can either boost the players or be a hindrance during the mission. Every objective completed will reward the player with 200 Requestion Slips and 50 XP at a base rate, with end-of-game XP multipliers boosting these numbers depending on the difficulty.\nEnemy Outposts.\nAn Outpost is a location on the map that holds hostile spawners. The Automatons have &lt;a href=\"Automaton%20Fabricator\"&gt;Fabricators&lt;/a&gt; while Terminids have Nests . The illuminates have warp ships. Similar to Secondary Objectives, destroying enemy outposts is entirely optional but grants additional mission rewards. Bigger outposts are more rewarding but are also guarded better and harder to destroy. Higher difficulties will have higher chances to spawn large outposts, but the total number of outposts is unaffected by difficulty. Specific mission types may have more or fewer outposts on the map, however. Outposts are split into three categories: Small, Medium, and Large. \nIt should be noted that contrary to semi-popular belief, the more outposts the players destroy in a mission, &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Mechanics\"&gt;the more enemies will spawn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Omicron is the farthest planet that Super Earth forces have ever managed to spread Democracy into, marking the summit of the Terminid Front. It is the only planet with supply lines leading out of its sector but it is also the only planet disconnected from the rest of its own system.\nTopography.\nOmicron stands as the Terminids' attempt at mockery of beautiful &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;. It possesses perennial forests and shrubs that can allure even the most loyal of Helldivers, only for them to be gnawed and maimed by the merciless insectoids. High caution is advised, as its sights and landscapes have been deviously left untouched in order to stun Helldivers with their siren call, leaving them exposed to many unforeseen ambushes.\nNevertheless, Omicron's temperate montane climate also makes it very alluring for colonization efforts, with many comparing it to the ancient Alps and the ancient \"Black Forest\" of Sector 4 or the ancient forests that could once be found on the northern portions of Sector 7.\nHistory.\nOmicron itself has never been the target of any Super Earth High Command issued orders. However, the brave Helldivers took it upon themselves to conduct several expeditions into Omicron, going so far as to reaching around 80% liberation of the planet in April 2184, only being unable to fully liberate it due to the failure of the Terminid Control System and the Automaton Invasion of Cyberstan, which left it unable to be accessed. Below, the tales of the expeditions into Omicron have been logged by the Super Earth Digital Archive of Valorous Acts.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nFirst Expedition - March 2184.\nThe planet was once the site of a military Expedition. A small expedition of at least three thousand super destroyers commanded by the Helldivers attempted to liberate the world during the initial &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin Sector&lt;/a&gt; Offensive during the slow march to Zagon Prime, and after the initial liberation of &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;. Omicron had also become the world with the highest known Terminid resistance recorded at the time.\nHelldivers were swarmed very quickly after landing and incurred heavier than usual casualties, which started discouraging Helldivers from assaulting the planet. The expedition hastily retreated after &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; fell, which coincided with the commencement of Operation Swift Disassembly in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only a few stranded Helldivers on Omicron who were listed as Missing-In-Action, as well as a number of unaccounted-for Super Destroyers that were still running surveys in the L'estrade Sector. High Command would reportedly express interest in eventually returning to Omicron and bringing the rest of the L'estrade Sector back under SEAF control in future campaigns.\nSecond Expedition - April 2184.\nA number of weeks after the First Expedition, &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt; was again liberated and the Helldivers mounted another expedition into the L'estrade Sector, now with four times the manpower. Starting with Omicron once again, the level resistance encountered on the planet was interestingly lower compared to the first expedition, with skeletal remains of giant unknown Terminid creatures being sighted more often. \nLater however, in an act of sinister syncronicity, both the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; launched large-scale assaults across the galaxy. The second L'estrade Expedition was put on hold, with the Helldivers being pulled back in a more organized manner compared to the last time and in an effort to defend Super Earth's citizens on two fronts at once.\nEventually Oshaune was once again liberated a week later, and the second Expedition resumed again but with numbers reduced to just over three thousand Helldivers active on Omicron upon resumption of the expedition, the number would swell to over forty thousand a day later. Omicron would be mostly liberated eventually as the Helldivers had secured most of the planet on April 29th, largely avenging the shameful defeat incurred more than a month earlier. \nHowever, due the failure of the TCS system, the Helldivers had to put a stop to any plans of fully liberating Omicron. With the TCS causing the bugs to mutate at a rapid pace, all SEAF forces were ordered to the Umlaut Sector, with the remaining Terminids on Omicron launching a fierce counter attack now that the majority of Super Earth's forces were off world. Progress made on Omicron was quickly lost, with only some operational successes like the successful evacuation of civilians, scientists and high-value assets.\nSecond Galactic War.\nApparition of the Gloom.\nFurther opportunities to deploy onto Omicron would be permanently destroyed on August 2184, when a mysterious nebula formed around &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt;. This nebula, composed by extremely high densities of intergalactic Terminid spores, would slowly begin to expand across the planets controlled by the Terminids, eventually engulfing Omicron and fully blocking it from further SEAF surveillance, as the satellites around Omicron's orbit stopped transmitting information back to Super Earth, like with all other planets engulfed by what is now known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy September 10th, there was only 1 Super Destroyer above Orbit, its status was only known to be operational at best. By October 3rd the Super Destroyer's signal went dead. It can only be assumed that all crew are lost and the ship is simply floating in High Orbit or the ship was pulled by Omicron's gravity and crashed onto the planet or crashed into one of Omicron's Moons. Whatever the case, the SEAF will eventually learn of its actual fate. It is also likely the ship is moving away from the planet on autopilot through the use of its subspace engines and limping back to Super Earth space by itself although this will take a very many years and eventually the E-710 on board will be exhausted leaving the ship adrift in space and by extension the Gloom.\nTrivia.\nOmicron is Greek for the Letter \"little O\" and is the value of 70 in the system of Greek numerals"}

It serves as a dual border planet with both the Mirin Sector, through its FTL line with Fori Prime, and with the &lt;a href=\"L%27estrade%20Sector\"&gt;L'estrade Sector&lt;/a&gt;, through its line with &lt;a href=\"Omicron\"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only planet in the Mirin Sector to not be connected to any of its neighbor planets, a case similar to Omicron\nTopography.\nThe planet's physical features are comparable to the British Isles prior to the last great war, particularly the emerald isle of Ireland. Little about the planet has changed since the end of the first galactic war one hundred years ago, save for a 50% cutback of wild vegetation and 100% reduction in .\nOshaune's landscape is quite varied, featuring wide expanses of lush, green valley's hidden amongst hilly highlands composed of limestone, bordered by a series of jagged coastal mountains. The mountains on Oshaune's coastline are generally made of granite or red sandstone, depending on the mountain's location.\nThe climate of Oshaune is mild, humid and changeable with abundant rainfall (for about 2/3rd's of the year) and a lack of temperature extremes. Fog is also common on Oshaune, particularly at higher altitudes; mainly during winter and during the morning at times of high pressure. The key industries of the planet are based around the extraction of natural resources through mining, as well as various forms of agriculture and fish farming.\nHistory.\nFirst Galactic War.\nOshaune is one of the few planets to see action after the conclusion of the Galactic Campaigns of 2084. As stated prior, it saw a period of Illuminate occupation but would inevitably return to the safe, nurturing embrace of Managed Democracy.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nActivation of the Terminid Control System and after.\nPerhaps hailing from its Irish-rooted namesake, Oshaune has had a blessing of good luck despite all the hardships it has endured. Once the Terminid Control System was installed on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, Oshaune would see a quick and successful liberation campaign, as many Helldivers, sickened by the horrors of neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, wished to see greener pastures and deployed into Oshaune instead.\nAs time went on and the war raged on, Oshaune would have its fate mostly tied to that of Hellmire, with its liberations and defenses often coming shortly before or after Hellmire and/or Fori Prime had fallen or were being liberated, as it would receive any Helldivers that didn't wish to deploy into the previously mentioned planets, which were full of rough, coarse, irritating sand, plateaus, tremors and fire tornadoes. Occasionally, Oshaune would remain free while other neighbouring planets fell to the Terminids, but this streak of good luck would seemingly come to an end once the Terminid Control System failed. It would be liberated in 3 occasions despite there not being any orders to liberate it, once during Operation CBCT Protection, another during the construction of E-710 Farms on Hellmire and other planets, and once again during Operation Enduring Bulwark, this last liberation contributing greatly to the success of Fori Prime's Defense Campaign.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nOnce the Terminids developed resistance to the Termicide, they overran and terraformed &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; into a Supercolony, unleashing chaos all over the Terminid Front. As expected, Oshaune's colonial defenses weren't capable of holding the line against the bolstered Terminid onslaught and, comprehensively, would fall to the fascist tide.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nHowever, luck would once more side with Oshaune, as scientists in &lt;a href=\"Moradesh\"&gt;Moradesh&lt;/a&gt; began to develop ways to deploy the Dark Fluid, with the ultimate purpose of destroying Meridia. On May 30th, the horrid Terminid Supercolony would be successfully collapsed into a black hole through the use of this superweapon, which immediately halted the Terminid onslaught and opened the lines back into the Draco and Mirin Sectors.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nOn June 15th, a new major order would be issued after the successful rescue of trapped children at &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;. The Helldivers were to liberate all 3 planets of the Draco Sector, Hellmire and Nivel 43. Despite this, a sizeable portion of the Helldiver Corps, weathered from all the prior fighting on Hellmire and the recently re-liberated Fori Prime, decided to begin deploying on Oshaune on the late afternoon of June 18th, in technical defiance of Super Earth High Command Orders.\nOperation Brute Force.\nOshaune's streak of good luck would seemingly end in June, as the Helldivers would fail to hold Fori Prime for long enough and, soon after, would be pushed back, as the Terminids solidified their hold on Oshaune. Ever since, Oshaune has remained under Terminid control, waiting for a return to Super Earth's embrace.\nEver since its fall, Oshaune has been engulfed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, a nebula of Terminid Interstellar Spores. As such, SEAF Satellites have been unable to monitor its status."}

Each of the Illuminate's limbs possesses 3 appendages, all of equal length for a total of 12 \"fingers\", 6 on their lower limbs and 6 on their superior limbs.
