Until September 2184, it was the planet with the highest regeneration rate in the Terminid front that is outside of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, with a staggering enemy resistance of 3%, a record high that other planets have been unable to hit under normal circumstances. As such, it gained a reputation for being a \"liberation blackhole\" during Operation Critical Mass and especially during Operation Liberty Tide, as it managed to have up to 60% of the entire Helldiver Corps orbiting it, yet not a single digit of liberation would be accomplished despite the amount of resources devoted towards it.\nOnly after 3 weeks of constant deployment of at least 35 to 40% of the entire Helldiver Corps, would Pandion XXIV be liberated, at the expense of 2 major orders and significant losses numbering in the hundreds of millions of Helldivers.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nPandion XXIV had remained in its lifeless gray stillness for most of the Galactic War without much incident. However, the Terminids quickly made their acquaintance with this planet, as the Terminid Control System's failure and the apparition of the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridian Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; would usher in a bolstered Terminid offensive.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nPrior and during the conduction of Operation Enduring Peace, Pandion XXIV would see itself besieged by the alien bugs in 2 occasions, both of them resulting in a collapse of their defenses and the quick restoration of freedom through a similarly swift and deadly liberation campaign. However, on May 30th, the situation would be seemingly stabilized, as the Meridian Supercolony would be destroyed and the Terminid advance crippled, allowing for the final liberation of Pandion XXIV on the early days of June.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nHowever, Pandion's peace would be short-lived. As the Helldivers resumed their advance back into the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors, the desperate insectoids seeked ways to safeguard their fascist species. Using &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; as their final launching pads, the bugs shot abnormally elevated concentrations of intergalactic spores, which resulted in outbreaks springing out on &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt; and nearby Gacrux, both of which eventually overwhelmed the colonial defenses and allowed for further outbreaks both on &lt;a href=\"Erson%20Sands\"&gt;Erson Sands&lt;/a&gt; and Pandion XXIV.\nDue to the higher priority of other missions, the Helldivers could not heed Pandion's call for aid. It would fall by the next day and remain occupied for the rest of the month.\nJin Xi-Falstaff Sector Lockdown.\nPandion's occupation would last for the rest of the month of June, as the Helldivers were diverted towards the Automaton Front, where they would accrue numerous victories over the robots. However, while they were gone, the Terminids had begun to spread over to the Jin Xi and Falstaff Sectors en masse and, comprehensively, were spreading at an alarming rate. As such, Super Earth High Command ordered the Helldivers to ensure both sectors were free for the Ministry of Expansion to conduct settlement missions. A number of key planets were ordered to be liberated and held: Erson Sands, &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Phact Bay, Acamar IV and Pandion XXIV.\nSince the Helldivers started with Phact Bay, Pandion XXIV would be the third to be liberated during the first week of July, right after Acamar IV and Phact Bay.\nOperation Brute Force.\nPandion would remain free for the rest of the month of July and for the first 3 weeks of the month of August 2184. However, the war would slowly come back towards Pandion. As the Helldivers were once again diverted towards the Automaton front during Operation Andromeda and other later operations, where they secured major victories. However, the Terminids would begin preparing a new, even more horrid offensive. As the Helldivers focused on destroying the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;, a massive nebula of intergalactic Terminid spores began to form around &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt;, which then began to threaten to expand towards &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Helldivers would be ordered back towards the Terminid front, as Super Earth High Command raised concerns over the new Terminid variants that were discovered in Socorro and the rest of the Falstaff sector. As the war continued into August, the cloud of spores began to soon extend onto other planets, earning it the codename of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy August 21st, the Gloom encompassed all of the &lt;a href=\"L%27estrade%20Sector\"&gt;L'estrade Sector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Zagon%20Prime\"&gt;Zagon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt;, Fori Prime, Erson Sands and Nivel 43. And it was threatening to continue expanding, as it bolstered a new Terminid offensive. As such, Super Earth High Command would issue a major order to hold back the advancing Terminids while culling their numbers as much as possible, as efforts to research the Gloom advanced slowly due to high numbers of counterfeit samples that were obtained during Operation Prometheus.\nOn August 22nd, the Terminids would launch a massive assault onto Pandion, which was unable to be repelled due to the higher priority of &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;'s liberation. As such, Pandion would fall to the Terminid onslaught, leaving it caught in battle until August 24th, as the Terminids showed unusual ferocity and resilience.\nOperation Overrun.\nWith Pandion's capture, the Terminids quickly reinforced it, nestling and burrowing into Pandion and rapidly multiplying in order to concentrate their forces. Then, on September 2nd, the Terminids in Pandion and &lt;a href=\"Partion\"&gt;Partion&lt;/a&gt;, a nearby planet on the &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Sector\"&gt;Sten Sector&lt;/a&gt; that had fallen to the Terminids during the initial February Outbreak, decided to launch successive assaults onto Phact Bay, with Pandion's Terminid Brood attacking first, sending the third biggest Terminid Superonslaught onto the planet, only being smaller than that of nearby &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt; and the one that attacked &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Benevolent Sanitation.\nOperation Critical Mass.\nDuring Operation Critical Mass, the Helldivers would deploy en masse onto Pandion, determined to break the unusually resilient insects and reclaiming the colonial outposts on the ashen planet. However, once more, the fascist bugs would somehow manage to resist freedom's graceful touch, possibly aided by the malevolent influence of the Gloom. As such, despite the massive presence of at least 15,000 Super Destroyers throughout the entire 3 days of the operation, no progress would be accomplished at all, leading to the partial failure of the operation, as the Helldivers would at least manage to capture &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as meeting the required quota of dead Terminid Warriors, which resulted in the fleetwide deployment of &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrages&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nHowever, the nefarious resistance of the Terminid Brood at Pandion became fully clear to Super Earth once Operation Liberty Tide commenced. While this ordered for the Helldivers to capture as many planets as possible, the Helldivers would persist in trying to capture Pandion-XXIV, with a surge in Helldiver recruitment leading to up to 35,000 Super Destroyers orbitting the gray planet during the first two days of the operation. Yet, despite such an impressive display of Super Earth's military might, the bugs continued to defy Freedom and prevented the Helldivers from doing any progress towards any other liberation campaigns while also considerably slowing down the progress towards Pandion's liberation.\nAfter the first 2 days of the operation, &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt;, being poorly defended, fell to the , leaving the Helldivers at a negative balance of liberation. As such, Helldiver Strategic Command began to search for opportunities towards quick planetary liberations in order to make up the deficit. The 2 best options that appeared were &lt;a href=\"Trandor\"&gt;Trandor&lt;/a&gt;, which had exhausted the bulk of its Terminid hives after 5 consecutive failed onslaughts onto Gatria, and Claorell, which the Automatons had ignored in order to focus on Clasa so that they could expand further into the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the consensus agreeing to Trandor and Claorell being the best options for resetting the balance, a significant portion of Helldivers chose to remain in Pandion, only continuing to be resisted and deflected by the Terminids there.\nHowever, even the most brutish, boneheaded and stubborn of fascists are but mere pebbles against the mighty sledgehammer of Managed Democracy. Once Trandor was liberated by the Helldivers on September 21st, all of its designated Helldivers would immediately redeploy onto Claorell and a now severely tenderized Pandion. Yet still, the Terminid scourge refused to die, burrowed into Pandion with an unusual devotion, even with imminent death at its doorstep.\nThe Bugs would give no quarter against the Helldivers, requiring them to valiantly uproot every ashen tree, every dry coral and every parasitic outcrop in search for even the most trifling of Terminid larvae, for Pandion would not be free of the fascist scum until the very last Terminid egg had been squashed.\nDespite their unusual, almost enviable efforts if it weren't for their Fascist genetics, the Terminids' fate would be completely sealed after the Helldivers managed to liberate Claorell. With Claorell's liberation also came the relief of an ongoing siege at &lt;a href=\"Imber\"&gt;Imber&lt;/a&gt;, which freed up the majority of the Helldivers at the Automaton Front to assist in liberating Pandion once and for all. However, despite all of the tenderizing and pummeling of insectoids, the Bugs at Pandion would manage to pull one last vicious trick before meeting their demise.\nDue to how much manpower had to be diverted exclusively for the liberation of Pandion XXIV, it meant that now most of the frontline planets in the Automaton front at the Talus Sector were left pretty much unmanned. The Automatons would see this opportunity to strike at the Helldivers, sending an assault towards Imber mere hours before the operation ended.\nStuck between Pandion and Imber, the Helldivers would first move to secure Pandion as fast as possible, while a significant chunk of the corps detached and went to relief Imber's defense. Yet, the Bugs played for time, evading their eradication as much as they could, keeping the Helldivers at Pandion for at least 10 hours after Imber's attack had started, allowing the Automatons to make significant gains.\nThen finally, on September 23rd at 21:03 SEST, Pandion XXIV was thoroughly cleansed of every single Terminid across its surface. The Helldivers immediately rotated towards Imber en masse, attempting to save the planet to the best of their ability. Yet, they could not get the required manpower to save it, mostly because of a significant contingent that had decided to rotate towards Gacrux to conduct eradication operations.\nOn September 24th, Imber's fate was sealed and its defenses collapsed, causing Operation Liberty Tide to fail, as the Helldivers had ultimately been unable unable to increase the amounts of net galactic liberation after a week of struggles.\nIt seems that, in the end, the fascist bugs managed to get the last laugh on Freedom. \nThe sacrifices of our heroes will be lamented, and their losses regressed.\nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nFollowing Pandion's liberation, the ashen planet laid pretty much dormant, its colonists returning to a home riddled with impact craters and seas of Helldiver corpses spread all over the planet. Whatever burials could be arranged were arranged, as the colonists in Pandion mourned the enormous sacrifice. However, the odious bugs, in their mindless hatred, would not even allow for our martyrs to be properly buried.\nOn September 30th, the Terminids at Gacrux attempted an attack on Pandion, as an attempt to plug the gap between their domains in the Jin Xi Sector. However, the Helldivers would not allow the immense sacrifice of their brethren to be defiled and deployed en masse onto the planet, repelling the assault by the noon of October 1st.\nOperation Freedom's Forge.\nHowever, the Terminids were determined to attain control over Pandion, for it served as the single best chokepoint to control the Jin Xi Sector. As such, while the Helldivers occupied themselves with the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; and the construction of the Deep Mantle Forge Complex, A terminid assault would hit Pandion in the late hours of October 6th. The underdefended planet would fall on October 7th, however, the Bugs were unable to burrow into the planet as deeply as they could before. As such, once Claorell was liberated, the Helldivers were able to return to a relatively unchanged Pandion, without as much Terminid resistance as before.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nShortly after having to hold the line at Claorell against the Automatons, the Helldivers would then be ordered to secure the planets immediately connected to Acamar IV, as it was going to be used as a Terminid Research Preserve for scientists from the Xenoentomology Center to study with. As such, Pandion XXIV; along with Turing itself, Crimsica, Darius II and Gacrux, was to be liberated and held against the Terminids so that Acamar IV wouldn't be connected to the Terminid broods at large not to the dangerous influence of The Gloom.\nSince Pandion-XXIV hadn't been fully lost to the Terminids since the failure of its defense, it was the very first target of planetary liberation. The Helldivers would swiftly liberate Pandion once again on October 12th, without as much bloodshed or tragedy as the prior battle in September.\nOperation Crossroads.\nPandion would get to enjoy its liberty for a mere 12 days, before the Terminids began to mount an offensive with the aid of a spore surge that came out of the Gloom. However, this offensive was timed almost perfectly with intelligence reports that indicated a build up of Jet Brigade forces at &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, which stood right next to the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;'s main construction site: &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Helldivers had to choose between liberating Lesath to reinforce the DSS' position or defending the Terminid Research Preserve. The majority of the Helldiver Corps decided to aim for Lesath, as it was preferable to lose the Terminid Research Preserve rather than to risk losing the DSS to a potential Jet Brigade assault.\nGacrux would be attacked on October 23rd from Partion, with Pandion-XXIV being attacked from Phact Bay merely hours later. Despite a detachment of Helldivers being left behind, the Terminid attack managed to punch through by October 24th, leaving the Terminid Research Preserve Vulnerable.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nPandion-XXIV would be lost for about 4 days, while the Helldivers were occupied fighting the Terminids in Phact Bay, in an attempt to reopen the front before the Terminids at Pandion or Gacrux were able to send an attack onto Acamar IV. Acamar IV's FTL Lines would be shut down as quarantine preparations were made. Shortly after Liberty Day, Super Earth High Command would issue orders for the liberation of Pandion and Gacrux, as well as the recovery of Matar Bay's Automaton Databases and the impediment of further Automaton expansion.\nAfter Phact Bay was swiftly liberated on October 29th, Pandion would see the rapid deployment of the Helldivers, however, they weren't able to deploy at full strength since they had to split the fleet in half in order to repel the Automaton advances in the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to liberate Matar Bay. This split would ultimately slow down Pandion enough to where its liberation would take almost a day and a half of constant fighting, as the Bugs had already managed to burrow themselves significantly into the planet, though not as much as during Operation Liberty Tide.\nPandion would be finally liberated on November 1st, with the Helldivers having to split once more, as Gacrux's liberation campaign started in tandem with an Automaton assault at &lt;a href=\"Demiurg\"&gt;Demiurg&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately doomed the operation to become a close failure.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nPandion would remain free of any Terminid presence after its liberation. It would seem that, after all, things hadn't come to boil despite the tactical miscalculation during Operation Crossroads. But the seeds of fascism had already been sown on the Terminid Research Preserve, and it was only a matter of time before their bore their nefarious fruits.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nExpectedly, with the Helldivers focused on saving the critical research material at Turing, Pandion would be lost to the Terminids by the afternoon of the following day, in a massive disaster that took millions of lives and undid all the progress achieved in the past 3 months."}

At least one Helldiver must remain near the extraction beacon during the process, or Pelican-1 will call off the extraction attempt, forcing Helldivers to re-request extraction. Upon arrival, the shuttle starts firing its powerful frontal gun at nearby enemies.\nA Pelican-1 performing extraction will remain on the pad until surviving Helldivers enter the shuttle, or mission time expires. At this point, a 20-second countdown begins before Pelican-1 is forced to return to the Super Destroyer.\nThough functionally indestructible, the shuttle has a health pool and can catch on fire and become unusable after enduring a certain amount of damage, and may depart immediately. This typically happens only when traitorous Helldivers directly attack the shuttle."}

Penta is noted to house several caustic chemical factories, vital in the production of the &lt;a href=\"RL-77%20Airburst%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nAlthough a seemingly a lifeless grey rock from orbit, the topography of Penta is actually comparable to some of the massive boreal and primeval forests of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super-Earth&lt;/a&gt; prior to the last great war, though obviously less colorful and much less dense.\nThe density of the planets foliage can range from being sparse to surprisingly dense, with rocky outcroppings, freezing rivers, drooping evergreen palms and colorless Cycad plants breaking up the banks of perpetual fog that cover the planet. The only natural color to be found comes from a verity of violet flowers that grow from strange, parasitic outcroppings.\nDespite its somewhat 'uncomfortable' temperatures, Petra is quite forgiving compared to other, more hostile planets, with it's abundant native foliage, plentiful water sources and an atmosphere that won't \"immediately\" freeze a human as soon as they step outside their habitats. Thus Penta is one of the many planets colonized by the Federation of Super Earth. \nThis planet could be compared with &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, since they have relatively similar flora and climatic conditions. \nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Invasion of &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 9th 2184, an invasion fleet of Automaton warships conquered Cyberstan and the entirety of the Valdis Sector then quickly began a massive offesive against the planets of the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Lacaille%20Sector\"&gt;Lacaille Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The defenses of the Penta-&lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; Line quickly collapsed, which led to the defense campaign at the Menkent-Lesath line. The few remnants of the SEAF, alongside with what little Helldivers that could be deviated to it, valiantly and heroically held out against the Automaton onslaught, but were inevitably overwhelmed by the 26th of April as all supply lines to the planet fell to Automaton control.\nOperation Legitimate Undertaking.\nThe citizens of Penta; loyal and unwavering in their commitment to the cause of Super Earth, were able to produce, synthesize and store tons of caustic chemicals vital for the production of a new support weapon strategem: the &lt;a href=\"RL-77%20Airburst%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Production of these chemicals continued right up until prior to, during, and even after the planets fall.\nHowever with &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; forces closing in on the last holdouts, as well as the colonists of neighboring Choohe also calling for help, it is likely that only the citizens and weaponry of the first planet liberated would have been saved.\nThe Helldivers would reach liberate Lesath on the evening of April 26th, securing a supply line that then allowed them to reach Penta on the 27th. With 90% of the planet's chemical factories secured, fleetwide distribution of the RL-77 could now commence. Most of the chemical technicians who had been trapped on the planet were rescued. Tragically though, some had already perished by the time we reached them, having succumbed to the toxic fume poisoning. The &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; showed no hesitation in the use of chemical warfare against civilians, but the sacrifice of these heroic martyrs shall never be forgotten.\nHowever due to the weapons still being prototypes, the airburst rocket launchers had some ... notable teething problems.\nExperimental Launchers.\nThe first of these was an overly sensitive proximity fuze in the airburst warhead, which caused it to detonate much sooner than it was supposed to (sometimes as soon as it left the launcher, which isn't helped by Penta being a planet full of small rocks and trees). Secondly was the high spread and blast range of the scattering cluster munitions, which although good for destroying large groups of enemies, also had a habit of killing the weapons user, along with their team and everything else withing 30-40 meters. Finally was the mishandling of the weapon by the Helldivers themselves, who aimed it directly at a target (similar to an &lt;a href=\"EAT-17%20Expendable%20Anti-Tank\"&gt;EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;GR-8 Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt;) rather than ABOVE the target as intended, which when combined with the previous two bugs results in a lot of friendly fire incidents.\nNever the less, the weapon still has promise with those who used the weapon properly reporting positive feedback, with at least one Helldiver reporting to the Ministry of Defense that they destroyed a &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Strider\"&gt;factory strider&lt;/a&gt; using it (firing between the legs of the walker with the shell detonating under it's vulnerable underbelly). The Ministry of Science have taken note of feedback on the weapon and promise a fix to the proximity cluster warhead when the weapon goes into full production in a weeks time, but until then the Helldivers will have to deal with a slightly... moody weapon.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nDespite the success of Operation Legitimate Undertaking, Penta's liberation would be short-lived. Just as the Helldivers prepared to push towards Merak, the Terminid Control System in the Barrier planets and the fall of Meridia would be the final nail in its coffin. As the bulk of the Helldiver Corps was diverted away to contain the monstrous supercolony, the Automaton Front collapsed, and Penta would be invaded and recaptured by the robotic menace during the month of May.\nEver since, it lays in bondage with the rest of the Lacaille Sector's planets."}

Outbreaks began across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;, including in the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; fell on the 7th of May. Following this, the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; would almost immediately afterward attack &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt; which fell on the 8th of May. &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt; would come under attack on the 10th, and with most &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; being distracted elsewhere, fell with little resistance. \nOperation Destiny Manifested.\nSporadic fighting would continue on Phact Bay, with little progress being made by the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt;, this was until &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Destiny%20Manifested\"&gt;Operation Destiny Manifested&lt;/a&gt; was launched on the 4th of June. &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; was liberated, followed by &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; then &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;. This left just &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which was liberated on June 7th, completing Operation Destiny Manifested. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; foothold in &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt; would be eliminated. Bringing managed democracy and freedom once more to all planets in &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Jin Xi - Falstaff Lockdown.\nThe liberty obtained for Phact Bay would not last for long. Due to the massive loss of lives during Operation Enduring Peace, the Helldivers had to constantly shift back and forth between fronts, often losing progress in one front to regain it in another. While the Helldivers were occupied in the Automaton Front amidst its expansion into the Trigon and Xzar Sectors, the Terminids would launch a craven assault in the evening of June 23rd, overwhelming its defenses and occupying it for 5 days.\nOnce the Helldivers managed to repel the robotic menace, they would return en masse to the rescue of the Jin Xi and Falstaff sectors, with Phact Bay's liberation now being part of the objectives of the major order issued by the Super Earth High Command. As such, Phact Bay would be liberated by June 28th, with the Helldivers managing to liberate the planet and successfully repel a surprise attack coming in from nearby Gatria, which had fallen to a spontaneous Terminid outbreak.\nOperation Overrun.\nPhact Bay would remain thriving in freedom ever since, its colonist beginning to undertake repairs and resettlement of the desert planet once more, while the war continued on in the neighboring sectors. However, this peace would not last for very long. From June to August, partly thanks to Pandion-XXIV also remaining free, Phact Bay would remain untouched by the war until, on September 1st, 2184, it would be assaulted by Terminids coming from the recently lost Pandion XXIV, almost right after the colonial overseer had restored its FTL supply lines with Gar Haren and Partion, a planet in the Sten Sector that had been lost during the initial Terminid outbreak in February 2184.\nWith the Gloom being found to be sending an augmented Terminid outbreak onto the Jin Xi Sector, Super Earth High Command would issue a major order calling for the Helldivers to retain control of Phact Bay, Gatria and Gar Haren while preventing any further spread of Terminid infestation.\nPhact Bay's defense would manage to repel the incoming Terminid forces by September 3rd, shortly after Gatria's defense concluded. However, their newly opened front with the Sten Sector, through neighboring Partion, would show it an ugly surprise.\nPartion, alongside all the other planets in the Sten Sector, had been lost during the initial Terminid outbreak of February 2184, which left whatever Terminid activities ocurred inside unable to be monitored by SEAF Reconnaissance Satellites. Even then, nothing could prepare Phact Bay for what would occur next. In the morning of September 4th, with Gatria already defending against the second biggest Terminid superonslaught ever, Phact Bay would be attacked by a massive Terminid force, only smaller than Gatria's assaulting brood by mere quirk of the numbers but still being the third biggest Terminid force ever faced by Super Earth, behind the ones encountered at Gatria and &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; earlier in August.\nPhact Bay would manage to successfully repel the Terminid Superonslaught. However, the Terminids at Partion then sent a second assault towards Phact Bay shortly after. This second assault would not be very notable but was still pretty intense, as Phact Bay had to be left slightly less guarded in order to help Gatria repel a second consecutive Terminid Superonslaught. Nevertheless, the defenses at Phact Bay held up, repelling the second attack and allowing a line of attack into Partion while also granting the Helldivers victory in their operation.\nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nHowever, the colonists at Phact Bay were unable to enjoy their recently gained freedom. Less than a couple weeks after the re-liberation of their planet, the Terminids at Partion sent an attack onto Phact Bay. After holding out for 2 days with what little defenses they could arrange, Phact Bay fell to Terminid control on September 28th. Then, a day later, the Terminids went on to sent an assault from Phact Bay to Darius II by forcefully creating new FTL Supply Lines into the planet.\nOperation Adamant Resolve.\nPhact Bay would remain under Terminid control for a whole month, mainly due to other operations taking priority over Phact Bay's liberation. However, slowly but surely, progress would be made, as the Helldivers would dive into Phact Bay whenever no objectives needed to be progressed. A bulk of the progress towards Phact Bay's liberation would be made during Liberty Day, with the only thing stopping it being the defense of Gatria nearby.\nBy October 29th, after an entire month of horrendous attrition, Phact Bay would be finally liberated, just in time to allow the Helldivers back into Pandion-XXIV and allowing them to continue with the major order's objectives.\nOperation Bughammer.\nPhact Bay would remain free of Terminid control ever since its liberation on October 29th. However, it would not remain free of the ever-present threat of the Terminid Horde. Following the disaster at the Terminid Research Preserve on November 12th, Pandion-XXIV would fall immediately to the Terminids, leaving Phact Bay exposed to further attacks.\nThis threat would build up slowly over the remainder of the month until, on December 11th, Phact Bay would be attacked from both Pandion and Partion, as the Terminids began offensive in the midst of new construction projects taking place at &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;. With Phact Bay having such a direct route towards a project of such importance, the Helldivers deployed en masse, hoping to form a security belt around Achernar in hopes of preventing any and all interruptions to the multi-trillion Super Credit venture between AM Defense and the government of Super Earth."}

However, in the depths of space, a new foe rallied and nurtured its strength.\nIn the first week of March 2184, the Automatons, heartless killing machines driven by socialism and hatred for the ways of Freedom, launched a surprise attack upon the innocent colonies in the Xzar and &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt; Sectors. Against its will, P\u00f6pli IX, and neighboring Ingmar with it, had been plunged head first into the Second Galactic War, shortly after the fall of Mantes a week prior.\nFrom March to April, P\u00f6pli IX would endure the horrors brought upon itself by the invading bots, barely receiving any Helldiver support (in comparison to planets like &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; during the same time period)\nHowever, shortly after the siege of &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Kwan\"&gt;Tien Kwan&lt;/a&gt;, P\u00f6pli IX's opportunity to return to Liberty would arise.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nOperation Swift Disassembly would be greenlit by Super Earth High Command on the last week of March. The first step was to liberate &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; in order to destroy an important Automaton Communications Array. On the way to Troost, parts of the Helldiver corps would deviate towards Draupnir in order to conduct secondary liberation campaigns on the Xzar Sector. P\u00f6pli IX would be liberated on March 29th, shortly before the Automatons were decisively defeated on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; on April 3rd, restoring peace on the planet\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nFrom April onwards, P\u00f6pli IX has remained free alongside with the rest of the Xzar Sector. But it did not regain the peace it had been robbed off as, a mere 2 days after their defeat on Malevelon Creek, the Automatons launched a second invasion upon Super Earth Territory, now targetting &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and all surrounding sectors.\nP\u00f6pli IX's colonists would conduct the repairs on their sufficiently-sized homes with dread on their minds as the days passed and they watched the Automatons approaching the Xzar Sector one planet at a time.\nOn April 25th, P\u00f6pli IX would be given a fright as the Automatons launched their first assault on Mort. This assault would fail miserably, showing how vastly overstretched the robotic colonizers were amidst their constant usurpations.\nOn late May, Mort would take a second assault, the Automatons committing more forces than in their first attempt yet, as expected from all who oppose the unquestionable rule of Freedom, failed once more.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nUp until June, P\u00f6pli IX stood on high alert as, while Mort had been defended in two occasions, the Automatons had hunkered down on &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; in the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt; up north, using it as a forward base on which to concentrate their forces. Then, on June 21st, a third Automaton assault took over Mort while the Helldivers were occupied with the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; Front. Super Earth would issue a new Major Order.

Then, on June 24th, they would launch 2 parallel assaults. One would go from recently captured Vandalon IV to Ingmar and the other went from Mort to P\u00f6pli IX. The Helldivers, in a textbook display of military prowess, would successfully defend Ingmar and defeat the invasion force on Mort, which would cripple the assault on P\u00f6pli to a halt, giving Super Earth a peerless victory.\nHowever, P\u00f6pli would not get to regain its lost peace. On June 24th, the Automatons made an unprecedented move. They would launch an assault onto Mantes through a new FTL Line they would create from Vandalon IV. Despite the successful defense on Mantes, this left P\u00f6pli IX with a new fear: That one day, an Automaton Fleet may appear out of nowhere to occupy it once more."}

The R-36 is a unique marksman's weapon that fire a highly-accurate, two-stage jet-propelled rounds, similar to the &lt;a href=\"JAR-5%20Dominator\"&gt;JAR-5 Dominator&lt;/a&gt;. However, these rounds are larger, and have a powerful explosive payload. \nDue to the unique load, the gun is a bolt-action rifle, requiring the user to manually chamber a round after every shot.\nDuring the first war, some early batches of Eruptor ammo were found to have an unwieldy amount of Orbital Airburst Strike shrapnel. Producing damage that officials categorized as \"unbalanced\", stocks were pulled from theater to study the absurd potential of the ammunition. Succeeding batches have proven rather disappointing due to shrapnel shortages, but manufacturers seek to reproduce even a fraction of their former power. During the second war, Eruptor ammo has been modified once again to add fragmentation shrapnel, making it still quite devastating, but more survivable for its users compared to its original ammunition.\n&lt;a href=\"Know%20Your%20Role\"&gt;Role&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe R-36 is an anti-materiel rifle. It fires powerful fragmentation round that deal significant damage in an area and also have limited anti-structure capabilities.\nHowever, it is very ill-suited for close quarters combat as its explosive, fragmentation rounds have a wide AoE, and is very likely to kill its user, just as much as the enemy, at these ranges.\nThe weapon is high-risk, high-reward. While its power will allow one to decimate a good chunk of the enemy roster on both sides, it is a bolt-action rifle, and so there is a delay between follow-up shots. This makes misses very punishing, especially in tense situations.\nThe Eruptor excels at destroying bug holes and fabricators, and can also clear light objectives such as &lt;a href=\"Terminate%20Illegal%20Broadcast\"&gt;illegal broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; and enemy transmission towers."}

It is recommended divers carry a decent sidearm for close quarters fighting and they go against enemies who fight at range. The upgraded scope allows the marksman to engage at further ranges with the higher damage output reducing the total shots needed to take down an enemy. It is highly encouraged to prioritize enemies attempting to call in reinforcements, as a single shot to these enemies can save a lot of stress in more difficult missions.\nAnother major difference NOT listed on the stats between the R-63 and R-63CS is the \"drag\" of the scope. The R-63CS, much like the Anti-Materiel Rifle, has scope \"drag,\" where moving your scope around quickly requires you to wait a brief moment before the scope is actually aligned with your target. The R-63's \"drag\" is almost nonexistent and allows for quick consecutive shots from target to target, but with the RC-63CS this is much harder to pull off.\nA recommended loadout is to carry an explosive anti-vehicle weapon, like the &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;GR-8 Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"FAF-14%20Spear\"&gt;FAF-14 Spear&lt;/a&gt;.

The first phase of the operation was to push the Bugs back to the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt; by first liberating all planets between the Umlaut Sector and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; was successfully liberated on February 10th, and Angle's Venture four days later on February 14th. With the first phase completed, the Helldivers readied for the establishment of the Terminid Control System. However, with surprise Automaton invasions on developed worlds, the activation of the system was postponed, with Operation Bulwark now taking priority. \nOperation Bulwark's main goal was to defend eight planets. The operation lasted for twelve days, with the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;S.E.A.F.&lt;/a&gt; fighting for every inch of the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;.

Operation Veld Containment was the next operation. Lasting twenty-nine hours, its main objective was to liberate &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt;, a strategically important planet.\nSpecial Military Operations in March 2184.\nDuring Operation Veld Containment, Terminid spores had engulfed &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelming the colonial forces.

High Command ordered the immediate liberation and defense of &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt;, so that S.E.A.F. reinforcements could repel the invasion.

The Automatons became aware of this, and attacked &lt;a href=\"Tien%20Kwan\"&gt;Tien Kwan&lt;/a&gt; on March 7th. Operation Patriot was issued, and within 21 hours, Tien Kwan was liberated, and the &lt;a href=\"EXO-45%20Patriot%20Exosuit\"&gt;EXO-45 Patriot Exosuit&lt;/a&gt; was now available for requisition to all Helldivers.\nOperation Valiant Enclosure.\nAfter being delayed for weeks, the second phase of Operation Valiant Enclosure was issued on March 12th. The Terminid Control System was to be erected on all planets in the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;.

The Terminids were now unable to enter the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing this success, the civilian population expanded, as did new energy demands for FTL travel. In response, S.E.A.F. High Command issued Operation Prime Liberation for the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Zagon%20Prime\"&gt;Zagon Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;. It was considered a nearly impossible task to liberate these planets, but a method of accomplishing it was devised by the Helldivers. First, &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; was to be liberated, gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; was to be abandoned in favor of &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt;, in order to finally reach &lt;a href=\"Zagon%20Prime\"&gt;Zagon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. The Helldivers would then liberate &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of liberating &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; as planned, a majority of Helldivers went to &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt; to get to &lt;a href=\"Zagon%20Prime\"&gt;Zagon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, as it looked like the fastest way there. In actuality, it took much longer to go through &lt;a href=\"Omicron\"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt;. After Operation Prime Liberation, many &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; corpses were left behind in the blitz. Civilian Biomass Collection Teams (CBCTs) were ordered to gather and process them, and S.E.A.F. High Command ordered the Helldivers to protect them during the Operation. The Order was easily completed, putting the &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco Sector&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; hands.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nInterrogated bots had leaked an Automaton plan called \"The Reclamation\". In response, S.E.A.F. High Command authorized Operation Swift Disassembly, its objective to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton Legion&lt;/a&gt; at all costs. This operation consisted of four phases:\nA long-range communications array on &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; had been identified sending signals into deep space, and High Command called for its immediate destruction. After the blitz through the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt; and the array's destruction, it was found to be broadcasting outside the galactic frontier to an unknown \"something.\" Also found in the wreckage of the blitz were blueprints for an &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;Aerial Gunship&lt;/a&gt;. These blueprints had made their way to Tibit, where the craft was being produced, and the loss of Tibit would cripple the Legion's ability to fight. Helldiver forces would have to go through &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; to get to &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed simple at first. However, the Automatons had already attacked &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; and were threatening to cut off forces liberating &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, a plan was created called the \"Ubanea Gambit\". Ubanea was to be liberated first, with a skeleton force on &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; holding the line. Unfortunately, the Ubanea Gambit was ultimately unsuccessful. &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir's&lt;/a&gt; defense collapsed, causing the S.E.A.F. to lose access to Ubanea. Helldivers blitzed through Draupnir and Ubanea and reached Tibit with hours to spare. Helldivers fought valiantly for Tibit, but the deadline was missed and the Operation was a failure.\nSpecial Military Operations in April 2184.\nMorale was low in the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers Corp&lt;/a&gt; after the failure of the Ubanea Gambit. To boost morale, High Command issued a Major Order to liberate &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. The Creek had seen non-stop fighting with the Bots for fifty-four straight days, but that had come to an end as within five hours of the order being issued, &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; was freed. But the planet would not see twenty four hours of peace, until April 3rd, 2184; Malevelon Creek Memorial Day.\nPhase 3's main objective was to hold all ground previously gained. With the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; on their last leg, they had invaded world after world but were now backed into a corner that they could not escape. The Automaton neural network is incapable of computing defeat, so with their last resources, they launched an all-out offensive. Their final offensive was to try and last just a few more days, but they had dug their own grave. Attacks on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; were easily beat back, and not even a sneak attack on &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; could stop their inevitable fate.\nPhase 4 was short and to the point: the annihilation of all Automotan forces. The &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a nation soon to be forgotten from history, now resided on three planets: &lt;a href=\"Maia\"&gt;Maia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt;. This scar on the Galaxy that used a non-democratic governmental system over four hundred years old would finally be wiped from existence. Maia was the first to be freed, then Tibit, and finally &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt;. The two months of tyranny in the west had finally come to an end. Freedom reigned supreme as the Super Earth Flag flew over the crumbling remains of the Automaton stronghold of Durgen. The end of the war was in sight.\nNow with only one front, the S.E.A.F. only had to eradicate the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; from the Milky Way and Managed Democracy would be the sole and righteous ideology in the galaxy. &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; were the only planets significant to the S.E.A.F. in the whole galaxy, so all were quickly liberated with ease. Minor communication network delays were detected in the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, but were nothing of importance.\nThe Reclamation.\n\"HIGH PRIORITY BROADCAST. ALL UNITS TO LIBCON 1. FEDERATION UNDER ATTACK. MULTIPLE PLANETS HAVE FALLEN.\"\nThis message rang out across the Federation as a massive Automaton invasion fleet jumped into the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Within hours, the entire Valdis Sector had fallen. The S.E.A.F. scrambled their reserves and all Helldivers were ordered to the immediate defense of the &lt;a href=\"Lacaille%20Sector\"&gt;Lacaille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hydra%20Sector\"&gt;Hydra Sectors&lt;/a&gt;. The new Automaton fleet far dwarfed the forces seen in the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt;, as they were evidently a mere vanguard precluding the main force. Sectors burned as the Automatons stormed world after world, and it became apparent that the Reclamation had finally come. The Automaton fleet was now hurtling full throttle towards &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. S.E.A.F. High Command ordered the Helldivers to \"slow its advance as much as possible\" so that the S.E.A.F. could recover and stabilize the line. Only four of the defenses were successful, with the fleet reaching &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda Sector&lt;/a&gt;. As the Automatons started to run out of steam, the S.E.A.F., now fully repaired, were itching for a way of getting back at the metal monstrosities. This would come in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;; an interplanetary defense line stretching from &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;. The Helldivers could not resist the temptation of such a battle, and within a few days, the line was completed, bristling with orbital cannons. It was widely believed that the Automatons would never risk attacking this line. With the Federation safely shielded behind the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;, the Automaton fleets decided to concentrate all their forces on &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; to try and break through and encircle the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;. They also deployed new &lt;a href=\"Factory%20Strider\"&gt;Factory Striders&lt;/a&gt; to the planet to strengthen their forces, but their efforts were no match for the Helldivers, as the Automaton forces on &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; were obliterated within days.\nThe constant defenses again struggled, as the Automatons had depleted the E-710 reserves of the S.E.A.F. As a result, High Command ordered the culling of two billion &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; to replenish their supplies again. Within twelve hours, two billion Terminids had been slaughtered. This was a monumental achievement which shocked all of High Command, but not all were pleased by this news, as a joint &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; offensive began to encroach into the Federation. The goal of the S.E.A.F. was to defend ten planets. Most of the prowess was in the East with &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt; being defended five times during the operation. However, the West was in crisis. The Automaton fleet had broken through the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, had stomped their way though &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt;, and had made it all the way to &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt;, The Automatons even launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, knocking out the S.E.A.F.'s long-range communications arrays and preventing the S.E.A.F. from tracking the galactic war's progress. As the communications arrays were returned to operating status, it became apparent that the Automatons had re-entered the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt; and attacked &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt;. If Ustotu was successfully defended, then it would be the last planet to complete the Major Order. The Helldivers fought valiantly, and Ustotu was successfully defended, completing the first Major Order of a defensive manner in Super Earth history. Huge swathes of territory had been lost to the Bots, but would be liberated three months later.\nOperation Legitimate Undertaking.\nOperation Enduring Bulwark had extended the Automaton's territory twofold. This could not be allowed, so Operation Legitimate Undertaking was enacted as a multi-stage operation to push back the advances made by the Automatons and retake &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first phase of this operation was to rescue citizens put in harm's way. Civilians had been trapped on &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; during the Reclamation, along with the &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RL-77%20Airburst%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Helldivers unanimously chose to liberate Penta, with Choohe never seeing a Helldiver until July. Penta was liberated and efforts were moved to &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt; where they continued until the operation was unexpectedly and prematurely terminated; a much bigger threat had emerged on the Terminid Front.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt; had failed. A Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; had been created on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and three more supercolonies were at risk of forming. Operation Umlaut Firebreak would be the most important operation in Super Earth history: if it failed, the Milky Way as we know it would be changed forever. The first Terminid Control System towers to be deactivated were on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt; had over 100,000 Helldivers on its surface when the last tower was deactivated. The &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt; Sectors were now completely under the Bugs' control, and a Terminid &lt;a href=\"Supercolony\"&gt;Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; was three sectors away from Super Earth.\nSpecial Military Operations in 1-15th May 2184.\nOutbreaks of Terminid spores that originated from the Meridia Supercolony landed on many worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Orion%20Sector\"&gt;Orion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt; Sectors. Operation Outbreak was issued, calling for the defense of these worlds. Most attacks were repelled except for &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, which was still under Terminid control. With this defeat, High Command ordered the decommissioning of two billion Automatons in order to receive the &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt; for the Helldivers. Unfortunately, this Operation failed, with only small territorial changes to show for the valiant but unfortunately unsuccessful effort shown by the Helldivers.\nSecond Galactic War 15-31st May 2184.\nDeclaration of the Second Galactic War.\nAt long last, the Second Galactic War was declared: all enemies of freedom were now officially at war with the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. All operations up to this point were only labeled as \"Special Military Operations\" Now every man, woman, and child would do their part by contributing to the war effort. &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;S.E.A.F.&lt;/a&gt; recruitment went up, and the production rates of almost everything skyrocketed. Additional S.E.A.F. Training Facilities were built, giving a 1.5% boost to all future liberation rates.\nSecond Galactic War December 2184.\nOmens of Tyranny.\nPreviously thought to be eradicated, the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; returned in a shocking attack on &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; on December 12th, 2184. All forces were ordered to LIBCON 1, and waves of new recruits and veterans came to defend the planet in Operation Ancient Vengeance, topping at 201,000 &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;SEAF Personnel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; fighting in the Galactic War on the first day of the attack. Soon after this, a new warbond, &lt;a href=\"Urban%20Legends\"&gt;Urban Legends&lt;/a&gt;, was released, and production of the new &lt;a href=\"M-102%20Fast%20Recon%20Vehicle\"&gt;Fast Recon Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; was started on &lt;a href=\"Achernar%20Secundus\"&gt;Achernar Secundus&lt;/a&gt;. As gleeful recruits dove to the surface of Calypso in their hellpods, the entire Federation realized that the Second Galactic War had permanently changed course. After three days of grueling fighting, Illuminate forces were finally pushed from the surface of Calypso on December 15th, 2184.\nThe following day on December 16th, 2184, Illuminate forces landed on the planets Genesis Prime and Mog, prepared to make a permanent foothold in the Milky Way galaxy."}

However, the Automatons, envious of Super Earth's advancements towards Prosperity, would soon make a move to disturb that.\nDuring the Reclamation, Gaellivare had cut all of its supply lines to the neighboring sectors, which helped safeguard the rest of the planets in the Talus sector from the Automaton offensives that would occur once they were stopped at the Menkent Line. However, where Gaellivare took proper caution to stockpile weapons and fortify itself, Shelt and Shallus, who were closer to the Sol System, did not, believing themselves to be detached from the frontline.\nThis notion would be completely shattered when, on September 6th, a then detached Automaton vanguard at Mastia sent an assault onto the underprepared Shelt, while the main Automaton force at Lesath decided to assault Gaellivare. Shelt would be successfully defended despite its lack of preparation...at the cost of losing Gaellivare.\nThe loss of Gaellivare immediately forced the Helldivers to concentrate on Imber, which would allow the Automatons to take over &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime. Despite this loss, the Helldivers would succeed in defending Imber.\nWith the failure at Gaellivare, the now resupplied Automaton vanguard at Mastia grew bold in its processing and, on September 10th, sent a double assault onto Shelt and Shallus. Nevertheless, the Helldivers, in an astounding display of resilience and commitment, would manage to successfully defend Shelt and Shallus, proving once more how Freedom will always triumph over tyranny."}
{"id": "5930", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5930", "title": "Shelt", "text": "Shelt is one of the four planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Talus%20Sector\"&gt;Talus Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Bay\"&gt;Aurora Bay&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Titanium Belt.\nShelt had been one of the many colonies of Super Earth in the Talus Sector for several decades, having been settled at some point after the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. Its colonists thrived amongst its beautiful perennial forests and its blossoming coloured shrubs. However, this prosperity was not to last for long.\nAfter the Automatons invaded the Valdis Sector in April 2184, &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; would cut all of its FTL Supply Lines, which kept the Talus Sector safe from any Automaton incursions. However, Shelt's colonial overseer, seeing his planet was seemingly far away from the frontlines at the Menkent-Lesath Line, did not care to prepare in case of future incursions.\nThis lack of preparation would soon prove to be a great mistake as, on September 6th, 2184, the Automaton Vanguard at Mastia would launch an assault onto the underdefended Shelt, in coordination with a bigger attack at Gaellivare. With mere moments of notice, the colonists of Shelt sent out a call for aid as they scrambled to mount a defense.\nIdentifying these attacks as an attempt by the robots to take over Imber's titanium deposits, Super Earth High Command ordered the Helldivers to hold the line against the Automatons and to hold onto Imber by all means necessary. As such, the Helldivers, seeing the struggling defense on Shelt as a threat to Imber, would immediately heed its call and drop en masse onto the perennial planet.\nShelt's defense would end up in success a day later. However, it came at the cost of losing Gaellivare to the Automatons, which forced the Helldivers to immediately divert towards Imber in order to defend it from the incoming attack, which consequentially also caused the loss of &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Shelt would get a couple days of rest while the battle centered on Imber.\nOnce the Helldivers managed to successfully defend Imber, the Automatons in Mastia, now resupplied thanks to their newly captured supply line to &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; through Gaellivare, would sent a dual assault from Mastia onto Shelt and Shallus, catching both planets unprepared.\nNevertheless, the Helldivers, in an astounding display of resilience and commitment, would manage to successfully defend Shelt and Shallus, proving once more how Freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\nOperation Leap Forward.\nHowever, Shelt would not get to avoid fate for long. On September 22nd, Imber would fall to an Automaton assault from Gaellivare. Then, on September 24th, as the Helldivers rushed to liberate Gaellivare in order to secure a construction site for the Democracy Space Station, Shelt would be attacked by the Automatons as they attempted to flank the Helldivers and take over Mastia in a gambit maneuver that, fortunately, did not occur.\nShelt fell on September 26th, as the Helldivers had to focus all of their available manpower on liberating Gaellivare. Thanks to this sacrifice, Gaellivare would be captured, forcing the Automatons to abandon their plans for Mastia, which subsequently froze the Automaton frontline, allowing for an unofficial liberation effort to begin on the contested tundra planet.\nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nShelt would immediately get stuck in a bit of a bloody deadlock, as the Helldivers had to scramble between manning the bot front to keep the bots away from Gaellivare and keeping the from reaching &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;, as a new Xenoentomology Center had begun construction on said planet and Super Earth High Command had issued a major order for its protection. As such, Shelt would remain stuck in a deadlock as the Helldivers attempted to keep the fascist insects at bay.\nHowever, in this uncertainty, the Automatons would spot an opportunity to continue their ravenous expansion. After falsely withdrawing most of their forces from Shelt, they then launched a surprise attack onto Mastia; leaving Shelt undefended, as pretty much all of its garrison jumped to attack the desertic planet. If Mastia was lost, it would have cut off the only supply line connecting Tarsh, the site of the DSS Logistical Hub, with Gaellivare.\nRealizing this, the Helldivers would divert what little manpower they could towards Shelt, in an attempt to rescue the still deadlocked planet in order to cut off the attacking robots. While a great portion of Helldivers detached, most of them had to remain at &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, working towards said planet's liberation in order to form a perimeter around Turing.\nThe battle for Shelt was fierce and brutal, as the bots that remained in Shelt gave no quarter. Amongst the vast painted valleys of colorful shrubs and gorgeous perennial trees, the Helldivers would masterfully destroy the enemy robots, blitzing through their outposts and bombarding their fortresses with all the munitions that their super destroyers could carry, with many Helldivers willingly taking on a traitorous status and then running into Automaton lines just so that the Super Destroyer would be able to kill more bots using the special ammunition reserve that is exclusively utilized for capital punishments against deserters.\n12,000 Super Destroyers were deployed on Shelt at the peak of the battle, with Gunships falling out of the sky and Super Destroyers taking heavy orbital fire, the debris of those destroyed serving to further rain hellfire onto the robotic scourge that plagued this Liberty-blessed planet.\nFinally, after hours of heavy fighting, Shelt was finally liberated on the 3rd of October, 2184. Not only would it's liberation see another world that rightfully belonged to humanity return to the Federation, but also cut the supply line of an Automaton invasion on the verge of overrunning defenses on &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; -- effectively killing two bots with one well placed bullet.\nInterim (December 16th - ).\nShelt would be left alone after its final liberation on October 3rd, with its residents going untouched for the remainder of the campaigns that followed Operation Alcubierre-II, as the Automatons mostly focused on Matar Bay and the Tanis Sector up to the galactic north. However, Shelt's population was not going to live any safer than how it was before.\nFollowing the activation of the Democracy Space Station, the Automatons would start a failed offensive towards it. However, the Helldivers would manage to relocate the DSS away in time, before the Jet Brigade captured Gaellivare, from where they would go onto Imber and be ultimately annihilated. Even though the Jet Brigade was destroyed, the Automatons managed to regain their old vanguard positions at Tarsh and Mastia, which left Shelt at risk.\nAfter the made a surprise resurgence on &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; on December 12th, both the Terminid and Automaton fronts were left essentially unmanned, which created an opening for the bots at Mastia to attempt an assault.\nOn December 15th, mere hours after the Helldivers' dramatic victory against the Illuminate on Calypso, the Automatons launched an attack onto Shelt, in tandem with a Terminid onslaught at &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt;. However, what the bots were not counting on was the fact that now the Helldivers had a higher number of troops available than back in October, mostly due to the activation of LIBCON 1.\nAs such, the Helldivers split into 2 similarly sized forces of around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers. The group headed for the Automaton front immediately began to engage the Automaton assault at Shelt. The race for Shelt would prove to be one of the closer defenses in the Second Galactic War. The Helldivers and the Automatons were neck and neck, vying for control of the strategic planet. With the Helldivers at 92% defense progress, it seemed that liberty would maintain its righteous hold on the planet.\nHowever, Super Earth's enemies would not bear to see liberated worlds. Just as it appeared the Helldivers would maintain their hold on Shelt, the recently defeated would do the unthinkable and somehow resurface at both &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Prime\"&gt;Genesis Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mog\"&gt;Mog&lt;/a&gt;. All Helldivers would be ordered to deploy to the defense of both planets as well as any further anticipated Illuminate attacks.\nThis malicious and vile act by the Illuminate would cause dire consequences. The Helldiver Corps at Shelt began to rapidly decrease as they flocked to the defense against the returning foe. As a result, the Automatons took advantage of the cowardly and evil act, using their mechanized avarice to take significant ground and thus capture Shelt a few hours later, as the Helldivers had victory snatched away from them.\nAs of December 18th, Shelt's liberation progress stood at a standstill of around 47% to 50%, with very few bots remaining on the planet meaning they could not gain full control of the planet. Simultaneously, however, the Helldivers have not been able to make real progress towards re-liberating the beautiful tundra world as they have been fully concerned with dealing with the threat of the . As such, the rolling hills and the picturesque landscape of Shelt remains in contested quarters until further notice."}

The fact Shriekers have their own nests makes the latter theory more likely.\nShriekers often attack in large packs, diving from a high angle attempting to slice open Helldivers and Citizens. If a Shrieker is killed while in the process of doing a dive attack, the corpse can still cause harm due to the sheer impact of the body.\nShriekers will almost always miss their attacks against Helldivers who are low to the ground, such as when prone/diving. Running is also a viable method to avoid attacks, as long as Shriekers don't fly in from directly in front or behind.\nShrieker Nest.\nShriekers spawn from tall towers known as a &lt;a href=\"Shrieker%20Nest\"&gt;Shrieker Nest&lt;/a&gt;. Capable of withstanding normal ammunition, it is advised to bring explosive launchers or stratagems to blow up these nests.

Making target acquisition easy even in combat zones with high fog or spore density. However on planets that are more rocky or full of visual blockers, it may be hard to identify the nests.\nShrieker nests come in two types. Risen and Divet. Risen nests are elevated onto a oily rocky platform that all Terminid structures use, Divets are similar to regular nests and will be sunk into the ground with small Terminid walls around its perimeter. \nRisen are easier to deal with, mainly due to if a Helldiver is without long range equipment, then the elevation would buy time for a hellbomb to be activated. Divets however, are harder due to enemy accessing the Hellbomb easier. "}

It is the last planet to have been made available in its sector, having been made first unveiled through Operation Benevolent Sanitation, as well as being the first planet to have ever taken on a Terminid Superonslaught, as well as having taken the biggest recorded Terminid Superonslaught so far with a Super Defense Condition of 40.\nTopography.\nSocorro III is a \"Foggy Swamp\", a variant of the Swamp biome seen in planets like &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt; that features Thick Fog instead of Rainstorms. The terrain is similar to mentioned planets, as its mostly flat land with treacherous water basins. The constant darkness of this planet is sometimes broken up by lighting in upper atmosphere.\nThe swampy nature of the planet renders it a most perilous land. The planet consists of one supercontinent spanning the whole world, with endless stretches of mud-soaked rotting plants and mangrove trees twisted among each other by their roots. The spores produced by the terminids, as well as the height and amount of trees, makes visibility extremely low. The high treetops also reduce the effectiveness of &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle stratagems&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Benevolent Sanitation.\nSocorro III had avoided much of the Second Galactic War's calamity despite its neighbor, Esker, managing to hastily spread the Terminid infestation it caught from &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; back in June 2184, partially thanks to the Colonial Overseer's careful move of cutting their FTL Supply Lines the moment that the outbreak from Nivel made planetfall on Esker on June 13th. However, the colonists of Socorro knew for certain that this was not going to perpetually shield them from the horrors of the war. \nAs the months of June and July passed, Socorro III would remain isolated, its colonists fortifying their settlements and stockpiling weapons, awaiting an eventual restoration of Socorro's connection to the Federation's FTL Network, even when the sector was recovered during the lockdown of the Falstaff and Jin Xi sectors and the First battle of Esker. However, as the Helldivers were diverted away, the Terminids also began to encroach back into the Falstaff sector, retaking Esker and Bore Rock before amassing their numbers on &lt;a href=\"Esker\"&gt;Esker&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 6th, the planet would face a massive Terminid superonslaught, at least 40 million broods strong, something only seen prior in &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Enduring Peace. Socorro III's colonial defenders sent out a call for aid, citing new Terminid variants as the local SEAF Outer Reconaissance posts were overrun. Despite the skepticism in some members of the Super Earth High Command, a major order was issued, requesting immediate eradication operations in Socorro III, as well as for the liberation of Esker and Bore Rock in order to establish a quarantine zone.\nWith the subsequent liberations of Esker and &lt;a href=\"Bore%20Rock\"&gt;Bore Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the days following Socorro's defense, its colonists would rejoice in their continued survival. However, far in the horizon, a new threat loomed over their home planet colony. Originating from &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt; amidst their courageous defense, a massive nebula of intergalactic Terminid spores was able to be seen. This nebula would from hereon become known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;\". \nAs Socorro's defense hardened, the odious cloud of spores helped send a second assault onto Erson Sands, in an attempt to draw Helldivers away from Socorro. However, in an act of bravery, Erson's Garrison would mount its own defense with what little forces they had, allowing the Helldivers to concentrate solely on Socorro's defense. Erson Sands fell, but their sacrifice bought Socorro valuable time to defend itself.\nAfter 2 days of long, hellish fighting, the defense of Socorro would succeed, however, the target threshold for Terminid kills in Socorro would not be met. Regardless, Socorro's garrison would be told to standby for a potential assault from Erson Sands.\nBy the time the operation was over, Socorro's colonists now breathed a new air. Not the air of freedom they had once known. Instead now breathing a thick miasma of fear, as a new intergalactic threat loomed at their doorstep, as Erson Sands fell and the Gloom continued to expand its fascistic mist onto other planets, shrouding them in lies and blocking the light of Freedom from reaching them.\nOperation Brute Force.\nDuring Operation Brute Force, Socorro III would see itself taken by surprise by a Terminid attack coming from the now Gloom-covered Erson Sands. However, the Helldivers, being on a streak of defensive victories after the liberations of &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, would manage to rescue Socorro shortly after successfully defending &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation Courageous Exodus.\nSocorro III would remain free ever since its last defense back in August. However, they weren't destined to remain free. Despite having escaped the horrors of the Gloom, partially thanks to the sacrifice of Erson Sands, Socorro III still presented a light volume of Gloom spores in its atmosphere, an augur of misfortune even with how seemingly impotent those spores were.\nShortly after the start of the Democracy Space Station project, a spore surge would kickstart a new Terminid offensive just as the space station was approaching its completion. Right as Super Earth was beginning to transfer the millions of citizens necessary towards the DSS station and away from their Gloom-adjacent homeplanets, the Terminids began a new offensive towards the westernmost planets of the front, with Socorro being one of the first targeted on November 4th, alongside Esker.\nWith a heavy heart, Esker was picked as a priority target, in order to prevent the Terminids from reaching Bore Rock or Erata Prime and further jeopardizing the evacuations. Despite this, the people of Socorro III would stay and fight the invading insects, their homeworld being overrun by November 5th."}

Their job is to eliminate you, your job is to spill oil and rain blood. Intelligence officials are constantly understanding the behavior behind these patrols and ambushes. Through hours of details analysis by a specialized group of Helldivers, we seem to have cracked their communications and have the following working theory on deployment decisions. Honor their sacrifice through victory.\nIt's important to credit u/gergination (Reddit), u/Psyker101 (Reddit), and u/Lexlocatelli (Reddit) for their dedicated work. Here is a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/s/Dp5CflXKt4\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the Reddit post that discusses this in greater detail (especially methodology) than provided below - which is but a humble summary by a simple scribe hoping to spread their hard work. A big disclaimer is that this is a working theory. However, this will provide some guiding principles on how to approach missions and objectives. With greater community involvement this theory will be able to be refined and corrected as needed.\nSpawn Types.\nStatic Spawns.\nThese are the guards of points of interest, locations, and objectives. You won't be able to prevent them as they exist before you even arrive.\nReinforcement Spawns.\nDisplayed in game as Bot Drops, Bug Breaches or Illuminate Ships; one or more &lt;a href=\"Dropship\"&gt;Dropship&lt;/a&gt;s fly in and drop bots, or one or more (indestructible, temporary) Bug Holes open up and release hordes of bugs from the ground, or one or more &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Ship\"&gt;Warp Ship&lt;/a&gt;s in Illuminate ships incoming.\nReinforcement spawns are triggered by an enemy unit launching a signal: either a &lt;a href=\"Commissar\"&gt;Commissar&lt;/a&gt; (or an Automaton &lt;a href=\"trooper\"&gt;trooper&lt;/a&gt;) firing a signal flare, or a &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt; (although other Terminids such as the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; can do so) releasing a pheromone cloud or a &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; detecting the presence of a Helldiver and summoning an orb of beacon. The Bot Drop, Bug Breach or Illuminate Presence will then arrive about 10 seconds later, a few meters away from the signaling unit.\nPreventing enemies from signaling (by staggering or killing them) can prevent these signals, and so in theory an extremely attentive Helldiver team can prevent Reinforcements entirely.\n\"Only one enemy-signaled Bug Breach, Bot Drop or Illuminate Ship can be happening on the map at a time\", and there is a roughly 2-5 minute map-wide cooldown (depending on Helldiver count and mission difficulty) between when signaled reinforcements can spawn. This cooldown time can be further increased with the &lt;a href=\"Boosters\"&gt;Localization Confusion Booster&lt;/a&gt;.\nObjective Reinforcement Spawns.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;Objectives&lt;/a&gt; will also trigger periodic guaranteed Reinforcement spawns. These spawns also arrive via Bot Drop, Bug Breach or Illuminate Ships, however they occur independent of signaled reinforcement spawns and are not affected by the cooldown.\nFabricator/Nest Spawns.\nYou see them appear from the factory/nest. Unless they encounter a Helldiver, they will remain in position. No data is available yet on how they function throughout the duration of a mission when Helldivers are not present in their vicinity. The presence of Helldivers within their vicinity do trigger unit production. Engage quickly and precisely to prevent being overrun.\nPatrols.\nA group of enemies that arrive on the map that will then have a designated path to walk. They often will spawn deliberately to cross a players path. They are the spawns that many players are decrying as unfair as they will literally appear out of thin air on top of them.\nPatrol Spawn Mechanics.\nThe following information should be applied specifically to Patrols. It is Patrols that are responsible for sneaking up on you while trying to complete an &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;objective&lt;/a&gt;. It is Patrols that are responsible for rushing your &lt;a href=\"Extraction\"&gt;Extraction&lt;/a&gt; site. It is Patrols that will call in Reinforcement Spawns. Patrols are the unknown in your mission. If you want to be in control of the battlefield and not forced into reactive gameplay, then understanding the Patrol system is key.\nSpawn Point Threshold.\nIt is best to understand when a patrol arrives through a point system. Once an area in the battlefield has accumulated enough points to pass the threshold then a Patrol will spawn. The higher the threshold, the more points it take for a patrol to spawn.\nTick Rate.\nThis is how many points are generated at a given time. For ease of communication we will be discussing any examples in terms of ticks per second. However, it is assured that the developers system is influenced and changes by the millisecond. The higher the tick rate the quicker the threshold will be met and thus spawning a patrol.\nBattlefield Constant (Baseline).\nThere is an established battlefield constant of threshold and tick rate. All actions taken by the Helldiver will either decrease the threshold or increase the tick rate. A Helldiver can take actions to return the threshold/tick rate back to it's original value, but there has not been found any action that would ultimately increase the spawn time past the Battlefield Constant. \nFor example, a Difficulty 1 Solo Automaton Mission will spawn a Patrol approximately every 192 seconds assuming the Helldiver has not take any actions that alter the Battlefield Constant. Any actions taken will ultimately reduce the amount of time between spawns making them appear every 180 seconds, 113 seconds, or 59 seconds. Helldivers can take actions that increase the spawn times from 113 seconds to 150 seconds. But there are no actions that will ever change the battlefield constant from 192 seconds to 200 seconds. The battlefield constant always results in a spawn occurring every 192 seconds.\nActions that Increase Tick Rate.\nPlayers being within an Area of Influence.\nCertain elements on the battlefield generate an area of influence. The closer you are to that element the higher the tick rate. For simplicity we will call this \"Heat.\" Heat scales based upon proximity. If a player is within 50 meters of the element (element icon on map) you are generating maximum heat. Heat generation then decreases by 1% per meter away from the element. At 150 meters you are no longer generating heat. Unless otherwise noted below, the maximum amount of heat that an element can decrease the spawn rate is 50%. Areas of influence will not stack. Rather the higher heat value will be used in spawn time calculations. The following are elements that have an area of influence that generate heat:\nActions that Lower the Threshold.\nCompleting the Primary Objective.\nThis is the single greatest factor influencing spawn times. Once the primary objective is complete the threshold is multiplied by 0.275. In other words you will be encountering patrol spawns 4 TIMES as much. If our battlefield constant was 240 seconds between spawns, then once the primary objective was completed you then could expect spawns every 66 seconds!\nEliminating Outposts/Bug Nests.\nDestruction of up to 50% of outposts on the battlefield results in no change in the battlefield constant. Once you surpass 50%, each additional outpost destroyed will lower the threshold needed for a spawn. This is a linear formula that when all outposts are destroyed the Threshold is multiplied by 0.85 resulting in approximately at 17.5% decrease in spawn time. So if there are 8 outposts - and it doesn't matter if light, medium, or heavy - you are able to destroy 4 of them without any effect.\nThis actually creates a unique interaction on the battlefield constant. So yes, eliminating these outposts does actually add more enemies eventually. But!!! In exchange you eliminate their area of influence. What this means is that you no longer generate heat nearby their location. This is very important to consider when looking at traveling lanes, points of interest, and completing objectives. It very well may be that the heat being in close proximity to the location is more of a threat than elimination of the outpost.\nMission Difficulty.\nHarder missions have lower threshold\nEnemy type.\nAutomatons have a higher threshold than Terminid\nPlayer Death.\nPlayer death doesn't increase the rate of ticks or threshold, but rather it adds a random number of spawn points to the point pool. At times this feels negligible, and at other times it can create a spawn 6 times faster than anticipated.\nPlayer Grouping.\nPlayer grouping has a special effect on spawning. It does not affect tick rate or threshold, rather it affect the number of points that a spawn could happen. A player is considered grouped if they are located with 75 meters of another player. Meaning that as long as there is an unbroken chain of no more than 75 meters between players then it is considering one group. But, if there are 4 players who are more than 75 meters from one another then you have now created 4 spawn points instead of 1. Imagine not only 1 patrol spawning every 66 seconds after primary objective completion but 4!\nPatrol Composition.\nFor better or for worse, the composition of patrols the spawn are randomized. Sometimes you get a group of 5 warriors...and sometimes you get 2 Bile Titans. Don't curse Joel; It's all about the random number generators.\nPopulation Cap.\nThere does appear to be a maximum number of units allowed on a given battlefield. More testing is to be done, but at some point there won't be any more spawns occurring. Granted, you'll likely be dead long before seeing that cap...but it does exist."}

Resembling large mushrooms, they present an environmental hazard to the Helldivers by constantly releasing thick clouds of spores into the air, greatly obscuring vision in a large area around it.\nIdentifying.\nThe presence of Spore Spewers on the map is relatively easy to spot depending on the planet terrain. On planets with little to no high terrain or hills, they can be seen from almost any distance on the map due to them emitting a very notable glow that can be seen through the dense clouds. Regardless of terrain, a thick green fog lingering around the Helldivers is a surefire way to identify that a Spore Spewer is nearby.\nStrategy.\nOn their own, Spore Spewers pose no more than a minor inconvenience to Helldivers, as their spores only obscure vision without dealing any kind of damage (akin to the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Gas%20Strike\"&gt;Orbital Gas Strike&lt;/a&gt; Stratagem). Their threat level rises, however, when they are paired with large bug Patrols or positioned near critical objectives or bug Breaches. The reduced vision can, in those situations, often prove fatal to Helldivers, as it makes it far more difficult to spot priority enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Chargers&lt;/a&gt; and camouflaged &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;Stalkers&lt;/a&gt; before they have already closed distance. If a firefight breaks out near Spore Spewers, destroying them should be a priority.\nSpewers themselves are easy to single out, provided one's minimap isn't obscured by atmospheric spores. They will always be found in very small bases with an oblong or circular profile on the minimap. If this is not available, they have a bright, bio-luminescent orange glow that can be seen from a distance.\nChanges to their has caused them to mutate and become far more dense compared to their original incarnation. It is no longer feasible to take them out with just thrown grenades. It now requires anti-structure weaponry or stratagems to take them down, such as the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Precision%20Strike\"&gt;Orbital Precision Strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Airstrike\"&gt;Eagle Airstrike&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"FAF-14%20Spear\"&gt;FAF-14 Spear&lt;/a&gt;. If using stratagems against them, be sure to place them under the spewer's umbrella for best results, as a glancing explosion may fail to destroy them in one attack.\nIt should be noted that sometimes useful items such as &lt;a href=\"Ammunition\"&gt;Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Currencies%23Samples\"&gt;Samples&lt;/a&gt; may spawn close or under the Spewer, therefore making it worth your while to check the destroyed stalk before moving on. Be cautious, as Terminids will be guarding the adjacent area."}

They appear to be mutated &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt; with camouflage capabilities and enhanced strength. There are reports that this appeared during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheories claim that this camouflage ability was the result of Super Earth tampering with Terminid DNA to make them produce more E-710 or &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; had some kind of secret Terminid weaponization program in an attempt to create an army of controllable Terminid Stalkers to stealthily get rid of or assassinate separatists or rebel cells on planets within the Galactic Frontier. Ministry of Truth addendum: While gene splicing is common to produce higher-yielding E-710 specimens, the Ministry of Science would never create a strain of Terminid to police its own citizens. Such talk is dissident speak and the implication that rebels exist is tantamount to treason.\nBehavior.\nStalkers behave much like Hunters but with far greater health and the added threat of camouflage. Stalkers engage in hit-and-run tactics, often ambushing Helldivers from outside of their field of view, then retreating once taking enough damage, or their target is killed.\nThe Stalker's tongue attacks can knock down and ragdoll the player from a greater distance than its other attacks. This is particularly dangerous in certain areas, as while the tongue lash itself does relatively low damage, the real danger comes from its knockback that can fling Helldivers off lethal drops, into environmental hazards such as mines, into groups of other Terminids, or against solid surfaces.\nStalkers are lightly armored, but have high health pools and a head that is hard to hit. Coupled with their camouflage and fast movement speed, stalkers will likely reach and harm their target before fleeing or being put down, though with adequate warning and/or concentrated fire a team can dispatch a group of stalkers before they do any serious damage.\nWhen disengaging, Stalkers will leap high into the air and re-cloak themselves mid-flight. They will then retreat in a random direction for a time, only to attempt an ambush once more when their target has lost track of them. While cloaked, the Stalker can regenerate lost health, making them a persistent and frustrating threat.\nThe time a Stalker will spend retreating is randomized, as they sometimes attack again mere seconds later, and other times after minutes have passed. They however, will seem to step up their attacks if a Helldiver is operating an objective near them.\nStalker Lair.\nStalkers will only appear if the current mission contains a Stalker Lair. Lairs can be quite hard to find as unlike normal nests they are hidden on the map until discovered by a player or by activating a Radar Station. It's possible for multiple Stalker Lairs to spawn during a mission and once they're all destroyed, Stalkers will cease to spawn.\nEncountering Stalkers usually means their den is near, though some can travel considerable distances, particularly on higher difficulties. A Lair can be tracked by paying attention to where the Stalkers are coming from, as they will always come straight to the player from their nest, even if the Helldiver is prone and wearing scout armor."}

The size of the nest's will change depending on the difficulty along with the number of enemies capable of being deployed from the nest's emergence holes.\nStalker Nests are a particularly dangerous sight as they spawn waves of &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;Stalkers&lt;/a&gt;; mutated &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt; that appear from thin air to perform hit-and-run attacks against Helldivers on the ground.\nIdentifying.\nThey look similar to a Terminid Nests, but can be identified specifically by the Large rock-like structures around the nest. If visual identification is difficult to confirm, it is best to utilize Radar Tower's or track the Stalker's themselves.\nLarger stalker nests are easier to identify due to the oily rock like structures built around the nests, these nests will be surrounded by a crescent shaped wall. Nest's are also able to be identified due to the orange pheromones being exhausted from the emergence holes. \nIf on combat zones that have intense spore coverage, utilization of SEAF tactical radar assets is recommended for proper identification of nests. If no such assets are available then utilizing a runner to ping nests is the best alternative.\nStructure Type's.\nThere are currently three types of Stalker Nest's, Light, Medium, and Heavy. \nLight Nests consist of only one hole and the nest will often be shaped like a crown or a moon on your map.\nMedium Stalker nests have one actual stalker one and one scavenger hole which will spawn 6 of them leading to a total of 8 Terminid units protecting the stalker nest. It is lighter in color than the light and it can look like a rocky rectangle on your map.\nThe heavy nest is the most dangerous as it consists of two stalker nests and can spawn 2-4 stalkers which can quickly overwhelm any helldiver team. It looks like a rocky oil rectangle, or a more elongated completed stalker map. \nStrategy.\nThe safest method to destroy them is by using an &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Airstrike\"&gt;Eagle Airstrike&lt;/a&gt; as it will also clear out any Stalker's or chaff spawning, Alternative methods include the &lt;a href=\"EAT-17%20Expendable%20Anti-Tank\"&gt;EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;GR-8 Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;LAS-99 Quasar Cannon&lt;/a&gt; are effective weapons to use against them as one shot from each will destroy a single nest. &lt;a href=\"Grenades%20%28Helldivers%202%29\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; are also a viable choice, preferably standard grenade types. Special Grenade types will not work.\nStratagems such as the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Airstrike\"&gt;Eagle Airstrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Laser\"&gt;Orbital Laser Strike&lt;/a&gt;, or Orbital Barrages can also make short work of them in close proximity. A runner can be assigned to deliver the stratagem while the remaining teammates provide cover.\nClearing a nest is a risky method, as Stalkers can spawn en masse with chaff and overwhelm any potential Helldivers in the vicinity if not quick enough."}

Each Stratagem has its own unique code consisting of a sequence of directional inputs between 3 and 8 button presses long.\nList of Stratagems\nList of Stratagems\nOverview.\nThere are several standard-issue Stratagems which are available to all Helldivers regardless of rank, such as the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Precision%20Strike\"&gt;Orbital Precision Strike&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"MG-43%20Machine%20Gun\"&gt;MG-43 Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt; stratagems. Players can gain access to more by successfully completing missions and gaining the necessary Requisition points to purchase them in the Ship Management terminal found on their Super Destroyers. The maximum amount of Requisition you can have at once is 50,000.\nEach player can choose four Stratagems to bring on a mission in addition to any mission specific Stratagems granted by Helldiver Command - this is a crucial decision to be considered carefully as it is the Helldivers' greatest advantage over their foes. Unlike the first game, you cannot have several identical Stratagems in your personal loadout.\nOnce the mission has begun the player is free to call down supplies or ordinance at any given time. However, as all Stratagems have a cooldown period that has to be waited out in-between uses, players are advised to plan ahead. Stratagems will also become unavailable after the mission time expires and Super Destroyers will leave their orbits.\nAfter putting in the correct code, a stratagem beacon is ready for deployment, and all that is left is for the Helldiver to throw it where it is needed. Once thrown, it will display a bright pillar of light that is visible to all Helldivers in the area, including the type of stratagem being deployed by looking at it. This will either be delivered by the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Pelican-1\"&gt;Pelican dropship&lt;/a&gt; \nA red light means offensive ordnance will be deployed, and it is not recommended for friendly Helldivers to be nearby. A blue light means either hardware delivery, reinforcements, or supplies, which poses less risk to friendlies. However, most hardware and reinforcements are deployed using a Hellpod, an atmospheric entry vehicle that plummets onto a planet's surface with lethal force. Anything the pod collides with will either sustain heavy damage, or be outright killed.\nOnce the beacon affixes itself to a valid surface, it is armed and will anchor itself into onto it, becoming immovable once the countdown starts. Note that the list of valid surfaces includes other Helldivers and enemies. It is a completely valid tactic to throw a stratagem beacon onto an enemy\u2014they'll be the unwitting target of a Hellpod calldown (DUE NOTE; only Hellpods will track the beacon except the following: Orbital Laser, Orbital Railcannon, and eagle 110MM Rocket Pods).\nCategories.\nStratagems are divided into four broad categories based on their intended use:\nModifiers.\nCertain mission modifiers may affect how or if stratagems can be called in. For instance, Hellpods or strikes may be off-target, or may have longer call-in time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stratagem%20Jammer\"&gt;Stratagem Jammer&lt;/a&gt; tower can also prevent activation of beacons in its area (Excluding &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;SEAF Artillery&lt;/a&gt;) unless disabled by a Helldiver.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cognitive%20Disruptor\"&gt;Cognitive Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; swaps stratagems codes with already existing stratagems, including those not selected for the mission. There is a risk of a poorly-timed code calling in a different selected stratagem than the one desired."}

{"id": "3987", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3987", "title": "Super Destroyer", "text": "The Class 6 Series Crewed Interplanetary Combat Vessel, better known as the Super Destroyer, is a faster-than-light capable warship mass produced for use by the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; of the Super Earth Armed Forces (SEAF). Upon reading the &lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Contract%20of%20Employment\"&gt;Contract of Employment&lt;/a&gt; and completing Helldiver training, each Helldiver is assigned command of a Super Destroyer to carry out their missions.\nGeneral.\nThe Super Destroyer is a relatively small combat vessel approximately 170 meters long and 80 meters wide. The Alcubierre Drive enables the Super Destroyer to navigate to any planet in the galaxy within seconds by warping time and space around the vessel. Super Destroyers are fueled by Element 710, an oil-like substance produced as a side-effect of &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; decomposition. Super Destroyers typically have names in the following format: SES (Super Earth Ship) \"Noun\" of \"Noun\", for example: SES \"Shield\" of \"the People\"; however the generic Super Destroyers seen in the distance are always labeled \"SS LIBERTY\". Players also have the choice to name their super destroyers at the start and any time during the game.\nExterior.\nThe rear consists of 10 large engines which the Super Destroyer uses to navigate local space around planets. The rear is flanked by two very large bracket-shaped panels that house the four outer engines. The middle hull consists of a large wide structure with what appear to be loading bays along the side. The front extends far over the bridge and consists of 2 long pillars flanking a larger center pillar, an antenna array stands at the tip of the center pillar.\nInterior.\nThe rear of the ship consists of the hangar where the &lt;a href=\"Pelican-1\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; is parked; on an upgraded Super Destroyer, the &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle&lt;/a&gt; is also parked in the hangar, and a large amount of ordinance is stored in the open. At the back of the hangar is a small access portal to the engine room. The main deck is an open area where the Ship Master and the Service Technician can be found. To the left is the Robotics Workshop and the Patriotic Administration Center, and on the right is the Cryogenic Chamber and the Engineering Workshop. The main deck also houses the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Citizen%20Edition\"&gt;Stratagem Hero arcade machine&lt;/a&gt; and a large television screen that shows news updates, commercials, and the 'Brasch Tactics' series of tips.\nThrough the first bulkhead is the Armory on the left and a series of computers on the right, the loading bays seen on the exterior of the ship are inaccessible and cannot be seen. Beyond the second bulkhead lies the Bridge where the Democracy Officer monitors the ship and its crew. A holographic is used by the Helldiver to select which planet to go to and which operation to take part in. At the foredeck is the launch system, for delivering Helldivers and their &lt;a href=\"Stratagems\"&gt;Stratagems&lt;/a&gt; to the field. It consists of four launch tubes, into which Helldivers and their resupplies are loaded. The observation deck allows the crew to directly monitor events on the ground, as well as inspect the ship's gun batteries and immediate surroundings.\nA belt of Hellpods encircles the deck of the Super Destroyer. An access port to starboard, next to the Robotics Workshop, allows a freshly-thawed Helldiver to enter the main deck. Helldivers from allied vessels can also return here to be re-frozen and transferred back to the ships they command. Additionally, two belts of artillery ammunition run along the ceiling of the bridge.\nArmament.\nSuper Destroyers are armed with a very wide variety of weapons mounted in front of and beneath the bridge. Visible weapons forward of the bridge include a one or two large cannons, two large self-loading rocket pods, and two large Gatling guns; 2 large triple-barreled naval guns are also visible mounted on the hull beneath the bridge. The only named weapon is the ATLAS Cannon, which fires the Precision Strike.\nThe Super Destroyer is capable of firing its precision ATLAS Cannon\u2014including specialized Gas, EMS, and Airburst shells\u2014a Gatling gun, 120mm and 380mm Artillery, a high intensity Laser, and a high velocity Railcannon.\nAmong the Super Destroyer's limited armament are the Helldivers themselves, of which four are devoted to each mission. This number can be adjusted using certain &lt;a href=\"Boosters\"&gt;Boosters&lt;/a&gt;, or if the last remaining Helldiver demonstrates exceptional survival skills to merit defrosting an additional standby. Each allied Super Destroyer provides its own complement of Helldivers to the mission.\nGalactic travel.\nThe primary purpose of the Super Destroyer is to bring Helldivers to contested planets and support their operations on the ground. From the Galactic Map, Helldivers can select &lt;a href=\"Objectives\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; to undertake. Orbital thrusters are used to travel between mission sites on the same planet. By selecting a mission on another planet, the Helldiver can command the ship to warp to that planet.\nThe Super Destroyer generally cannot be commanded to travel to a fully liberated or a fully occupied planet. One general exception is made for travel to Mars, to replenish their supply of fully-trained recruits following their tutorial mission. A notable exception occurred during the last major operation on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, when an immediate general retreat was issued as the planet collapsed under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet retreated to Super Earth to regroup. Ships may still travel to Meridia, which has since become a black hole.\nInfrequently, a Super Destroyer may still be in orbit around a planet that has just been liberated or lost. If the Helldiver is in the middle of an operation, they may complete the rest of the operation before they must adhere to the retreat order. However, the operation may be more difficult as fewer Helldivers will be able to join.\nAllied travel.\nHelldivers can join their fellows by selecting their active mission sites, or using the Social menu interface. Allied Helldivers will remain aboard the squad leader's Super Destroyer in between missions, and drop in with the squad during missions. Players can leave the squad using the game menu, or by returning to the stasis pod chamber.\nOrbital support.\nDuring a mission, the Super Destroyer maintains an altitude of roughly one kilometer above the center of the mission area. This affects the angle at which orbital strikes impact the mission area\u2014nearly vertical towards the center of the map, and at more oblique angles towards the edge of a map. In some cases, very tall terrain or structures may prevent a strike from hitting its intended target.\nCircumstances may affect a Super Destroyer's ability to provide timely and accurate strikes, resulting in such missions being classed at a higher difficulty level. For instance, Atmospheric Interference makes it harder for the gun crews to stay on target, while Orbital Fluctuations force the Super Destroyer to devote more attention to maintaining position.\nThe Super Destroyer will maintain altitude until the mission timer expires, at which point it must return to low geostationary orbit. Stratagems then become unavailable (Excluding the &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;SEAF Artillery&lt;/a&gt; if the team has completed this sub-objective). Reinforcements will also be unavailable, forcing the Helldivers on the ground to rely on their dropped assets. Finally, an emergency shuttle will be launched, which starts the extraction timer.\nShould a Helldiver threaten to abandon their mission by being outside the mission boundary too long, immediate judgment is passed upon the offender. The newly-branded traitor will thereafter be targeted by the Super Destroyer's artillery, unless they somehow manage to reach the extraction shuttle.\nShip module upgrades.\nPatriotic Administration Center.\nDonation Access License: \"Purchases permanent access to ammo provided by the \"Support Our Heros\" fund, which allows patriotic family members to donate supplies to their loved ones in the field.\"\nStreamlined Request Process: \"Pre-approves the following forms in the Support Weapon Approval Process: Form 99-C (Justification for Munitions), Form 88-1 (Democratic Impact Worksheet), &amp;

It is the home world of Humanity and the capital planet of the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. \nGeography.\nSuper Earth, being the shining bastion of Prosperity, Liberty and Managed Democracy that it has always been, is possibly the only planet in the entire galaxy to feature multiple biomes. However, due to the Great War, its northern hemisphere has been rendered partially uninhabitable. Nevertheless, Super Earth managed to eventually optimize itself into seven separate sectors.\nSector 1.\nFormerly known as \"Oceania\", this sector is mostly comprised of an arid desert continent formally known as Australia, along with several tropical islands, archipelagos, and peninsulas that once formed part of a continent called \"Asia\". It is the home of Mega City 1.\nSector 2.\nMuch of Sector 2 consists of lands formerly known as \"China\" and \"Asia\", with territory stretching north into the area once known as \"Mongolia\" and \"Siberia\". The eastern and central parts of this sector are mostly comprised of ancient mountains and forests. Deserts and parts of an arid steppe are found to the north and west. Wild horsemen once roamed freely in this land, the spirit of Freedom burning ablaze in their hearts. This Sector is home to the Great Wall of Democracy, as well as Mega City 2.\nSector 3.\nFormerly known as \"Russia\" by some, and \"Scandinavia\" by others, this sector is mostly comprised of cold mountains, tundras, fjords and ice fields that will freeze the enemies of freedom. To its north and south lie wasteland zones that cannot be inhabited, being products of the Great War. This Sector is home to Prosperity City, the illustrious capital of the Federation of Super Earth. This sector also consists of two islands formerly known as \"Greenland\" and \"Iceland\", as well as being home to the Emergency Seed Vault on an island formerly known as \"Svalbard.\"\nSector 4.\nFormerly known as \"Europe\", this Sector is one of the most urbanized in Super Earth, having seen the lion's share of Super Earth's foundational history. To its north lies a now-uninhabitable set of islands formerly known as \"The British Isles\". These isles are speculated to be where the phrase \"How about a nice cup of Liber-tea!\" originated from. This Sector is the home of Mega City 4, and the landscape consists of plains, mountains, and forests. Its southern portion shares the ancient continent of \"Africa\" with Sector 5, covering much of the western Sahara Desert and the Atlas Mountains.\nSector 5.\nFormerly known by the names of \"India\" and \"Arabia\", Sector 5 consists of many different lands. It encapsulates areas formerly known as the \"Arabian Peninsula\", \"India\", the southern portion of the ancient continent of \"Asia\", and the easternmost portion of the ancient continent of \"Africa\" in which it is rumoured that the first humans were born. Much of the sector is dry and hot, with over half of the sector consisting of scorching deserts. It possesses two of the last three remaining rainforests and is home to Mega City 5 and the Pyramids of Super Earth.\nSector 6.\nFormerly known as \"Latin America\", Sector 6 consists of the Central and Southern portions of the ancient continent of \"America\". It also manages the southern portions of the land formerly known as \"the United States of America\". This sector is home to Mega City 6 and houses one of the last three remaining rainforests.\nSector 7.\nFormerly known as \"the United States of America\", Sector 7 consists of the Northern portions of the ancient continent of \"America\". This Sector is rumoured to have been the birthplace of Super Earth's core tenets of Freedom and Democracy, with its inhabitants having a reputation of high patriotism and love for their compatriots, values that would later be imprinted into all Super Earth citizens.\nSector 7 is home to to Mega City 7, as well as Superstone Park.\nOceans and Poles.\nSuper Earth's mass is comprised of around 70% water, which required the division of its water masses into 3 sections:\nThere used to be permafrost ice caps on both the north and south poles of Super Earth known as \"Antarctica\" and \"the Arctic\". However, these ice caps were melted away at some point prior to the First Galactic War, as their ice was incapable of sustaining all of mankind's prosperity.\nHistory.\nCreation of Earth.\nSuper Earth, or Earth as it was previously known, was formed 4.5 billion years ago. It was a planet comparable to &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; with extreme temperatures and oceans of lava. Later on, a planet roughly the same size as &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, named Thea, collided with Earth. The rock and debris from this collision formed a ring around the Earth until it eventually coalesced into the Super Moon.\nLife on Earth.\nThe planet eventually began to cool, and oceans of liquid water would cover most of its surface. Life would come to thrive on the planet, and some creatures went on to colonize the land, one day evolving into Humans.\nAncient Civilisations.\nThe first Human civilization was located in Mesopotamia. Other civilizations arose in Greece, Egypt, India, China, and Central America. These societies were mostly agricultural, located near rivers and fertile land.\nModern Civilization.\nAn Industrial Revolution took over the world with the invention of steam power, allowing for the entire world to be colonized and claimed. Millions found employment, and the economy flourished. One hundred years after the first Industrial Revolution, the first major global conflict would begin, known as World War One. The war would grip the world for four long years until the Treaty of Versailles ended the war on November 11th, 1918. Twenty-one years of peace would come to pass until World War Two, lasting six years and ending with a Japanese surrender on September 2nd, 1945. The post-war world would find itself embroiled in a Cold War between the victors of World War Two, the United States and the Soviet Union. The Cold War lasted for 44 years and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union on December 26th, 1991.\nThe Great War.\nThe exact year in which the Great War began is lost to time, but it likely happened sometime between 2015 to 2044. The war most likely included the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Most of Russia's population centres were wiped out along with the United Kingdom, as well as some parts of Alaska, Siberia, and Canada. Although the conflict utilized nuclear weapons, it left the United States and China mostly unscathed.\nUnification of Earth and Establishment of the Federation of Super Earth.\nOut of the dust of the Great War, one government stood tall. They created a new way of government, Managed Democracy, and achieved total unification of the planet to a previously unseen extent. They ventured far out into space, proclaiming themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Federation of Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, thusly creating a utopia of Freedom and Prosperity. No enemy of the Federation has ever even come close to contesting with Super Earth, not even a &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;three front war&lt;/a&gt; against Humanity could threaten them. However, recent events have been painting a worrying picture. &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; creeps across the Galaxy with no sign of stopping, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; have encroached on Federation space to get as close as one sector away from the home of Managed Democracy, and the &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;Illuminate&lt;/a&gt; have returned after a hundred year exile, abducting Super Earth citizens for vile purposes."}
{"id": "6382", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6382", "title": "Super Earth Armed Forces", "text": "The Super Earth Armed Forces (S.E.A.F.) are the armed forces of &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The S.E.A.F. is split into different branches, including the Super Earth Army, Navy, Colonial Guard and of course the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver Corps&lt;/a&gt;, whom receive their &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; directly from High Command. Raw recruits typically go through a rigorous 72-hour S.E.A.F. basic training course, before being assigned to a branch or being given more specialized training, such as the 8-week Superior Packing Methodology (SPM) training course for Super Destroyer crews, or the \"Real Deal\" Helldiver training on &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.\nSEAF Branches.\nNote: The following is based on both in game sources and also a heavy amount of speculation. The &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver Corps&lt;/a&gt; also have their own page. For more on the Ministry which the SEAF is subordinate to, see the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuper Earth Army.\nWhilst the Helldivers are the scalpel of the military might of &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the regular army corps are its hammer, responsible for the bulk of the fighting in the Galactic War, as well as taking over more permanent security duties over liberated planets. While the exact strength of the Army Corps is highly classified, the army is likely the largest of the branches in sheer numbers as they can hold multiple fronts on dozens of planets -- something that will likely require vast reserves of manpower numbering in the tens of billions.\nBefore the official declaration of the Second Galactic War however, the bulk of the Army was on a peacetime standing, spread across the frontiers of the federation maintaining security over various military installations, forward command bases, outposts, communication arrays and training facilities. This paltry peacetime peacekeeper force has also since been reinforced with billions of \"voluntary conscripts\" following the official declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny on May 15th, 2184, with new recruits rushed through basic training to reinforce frontlines and help establish critical infrastructure to train more conscripted volunteers.The Army possesses overwhelming firepower in the form of &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Artillery\"&gt;heavy artillery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Launch%20ICBM\"&gt;ICBM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20SAM%20Site\"&gt;SAM sites&lt;/a&gt;, as well as armored vehicles such as &lt;a href=\"EXO-45%20Patriot%20Exosuit\"&gt;exosuits&lt;/a&gt; and (the latter of which the automatons have made inferior copies). Additionally, the Army is the branch from which the Helldivers are drafted from, at least during the First Galactic War.\nTheir bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and anti-democratic values cannot be understated. High Command maintains that any lost ground is a temporary tactical decision to draw the enemy into the blinding light of justice and liberty. The Army has never suffered a (total) defeat, but has willingly expended lives in the pursuit of drawing the enemies of Democracy into traps or fighting valiant delaying actions to allow for civilians to evacuate safely.\nEven when forced to withdraw from a planet, the Army will simply lick its wounds and return in greater force. Even so, individual casualties are high, and soldiers deployed to exceptionally hazardous postings will be granted an increase in citizenship class for themselves and their immediate families upon mission completion or death.\nEngineering corps.\nThe Super Earth Army also possesses its own Engineering corps, responsible for building various SEAF installations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;TCS Towers&lt;/a&gt; and the Orbital Defenses of the Menkent Line. The Engineering corps also provides technical support and repairs (as seen when the communication array on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; was knocked out). These military engineering units will sometimes be supplemented with civilian contractors when necessary.\nAnother notable branch of the Super Earth Army (likely operating under the S.E.A.F. engineering corps) is the Excavation Corps; who were founded by SGM Janet Jones, who famously said that \"The ground is just another obstacle that hasn't yet been cleared.\" The Excavation Corps are an engineering unit that are presumably responsible for systematic drilling and blasting for surface excavations deemed strategically valuable. They make heavy use of explosives and the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Detonation\"&gt;CE-27 Ground Breaker&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nPresumably they were on the ground of Planet X-45 uncovering the formerly lost Advanced Weapons Lab built there by Super Earth. Their founders motto of the ground being just another obstacle that hasn't yet been cleared has became iconic to all those who've worked alongside the Excavation Corps. A specialized set of gear was also developed for them, known as the CE-27 Ground Breaker armor, which allowed for the carrying of additional explosives.\n&lt;a href=\"Viper%20Commandos\"&gt;Viper Commandos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Viper Commandos are a storied S.E.A.F. special operations unit whose real exploits are portrayed in the classic comic book series \"Tales of the Viper Commandos\". For example, Jackle 6, a veteran of the Viper Commandos in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; (whose uniform became the basis for the &lt;a href=\"PH-9%20PREDATOR\"&gt;PH-9 PREDATOR&lt;/a&gt; Medium Armour) held off an entire &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; brood on &lt;a href=\"Nublaria%20I\"&gt;Nublaria&lt;/a&gt;, a planet in the Celeste Sector, with nothing but a &lt;a href=\"MG-43%20Machine%20Gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;, pocket knife, and &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Laser\"&gt;Orbital Laser Strikes&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Freedom%27s%20Flame\"&gt;361st Freedom's Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 361st \"Freedom's Flame\" Unit was an S.E.A.F special operations unit whose final mission is documented in the graphic novel \"The Breach\", in which the entire unit was deployed right into the heart of a Supervolcano located in an unknown planet that was once besieged by a massive swarm of Terminids. The entire unit would be wiped out after they triggered an eruption in order to wipe out the Terminids.\n&lt;a href=\"Chemical%20Agents\"&gt;Chemical Agents and Division Zero&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Chemical Agents, also known as the Noxious Rangers, are the division of the Super Earth Armed Forces tasked with defending against and using chemical and biological weapons. Unfortunately due to a lax in proper distancing rules, an unfortunate outbreak of Carcino-Plague was caused, with many of Super Earth's citizens being consequently infected.\nBut from tragedy would be born hope, as the bio-warfare pioneers of Division Zero would be conscripted from the quarantine zones and hospices to spread their Carcino-Plague on the battlefield. The incident would be immortalized through &lt;a href=\"Patient%20Zero%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Patient Zero's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20of%20Safe%20Distance\"&gt;Standard of Safe Distance&lt;/a&gt;, so that their sacrifice might be remembered and that another unfortunate outbreak of Carcino-Plague would never happen again.\nSuper Earth Navy.\nBy far the largest and most sought after branch within the Super Earth Armed Forces, the Super Earth Navy is Super Earth's aerospace service branch, responsible for maintaining and crewing its space borne warships like the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty-Class%20Cruiser\"&gt;Liberty-Class Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, as well as aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Pelican-1\"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, and a fleet of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Bomber\"&gt;bombers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Navy's primary mission is to defend and spread freedom and economic prosperity by providing orbital support to S.E.A.F. forces planetside. They are also responsible for maintaining orbital dominance and keeping the Faster-Than-Light Lanes open, as well as transporting military personnel and equipment wherever they are needed. Many in the outer colonies seek to join the Navy as their way to do their part for Super Earth and see the stars, filling the ranks of &lt;a href=\"Service%20Technician\"&gt;technicians&lt;/a&gt;, navigators, &lt;a href=\"Ship%20Master\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt;, communication operators and weapon specialists.\nUnsurprisingly, the Super Earth Navy is the current dominant spaceborne navy in the Galaxy. The only other fleet that comes anywhere close to matching the Super Earth Navy is the Automaton fleet, with tens of thousands of &lt;a href=\"Automaton%20Fleet%20Destroyer\"&gt;Automaton Fleet Destroyers&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy's arsenal ranges from the modern Super Destroyer to the larger Liberty-Class Cruisers, to the many orbital space stations and defense platforms that protect many a world.\nThough the figures of its exact size are unclear, the Super Earth Navy is likely the Galaxy's most powerful navy, as well as the most numerous, with numbers clocking in at over twelve million active vessels (based on Helldiver numbers, as each active diver gets a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;). While the primary warship of the Super Earth Navy is the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, the navy also possesses heavier warships in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty-Class%20Cruiser\"&gt;Liberty-Class Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, which presumably surpasses the Destroyer in both size and armament. The pride of the Navy however is the Democracy Space Station, a colossal battle station that is equal parts battleship, carrier and logistical support vessel, the &lt;a href=\"DSS\"&gt;DSS&lt;/a&gt; is the most powerful strategic tool in the Navy's current arsenal.\nDemocracy Class Interplanetary Battle Stations.\nWhile the details of the project remain highly classified, during the First Galactic War, an advanced weapons lab on the planet &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; was working on the development of a powerful interplanetary battle station. However, the project was abandoned along with the laboratory (and the planet) due to high levels of radiation on X-45 -- possibly following the responsible use of planet-wide nuclear weapons bombardment.\nAfter months of intense research, on September 25th, 2184, (almost) final plans for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; were approved and construction of was finally ready to begin (once the planet of &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; was liberated). The DSS promises to be a powerful strategic tool for reshaping the Galactic Map \u2014 democratically directed by the Helldivers themselves. Details on the exact layout and capabilities of the DSS are naturally highly classified. However, the construction site of the space station itself utterly dwarfs the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; of the Super Earth Navy.\nConstruction would officially complete on November 13th, 2184, with the Station completing it's trials and first test fire against a small moon later that day, before being immediately commissioned into the Super Earth Navy. However rather than be under regular navy control, the decision was made by High Command to have the station itself be controlled collectively by the Helldiver Corps, via the Galactic Map. Whilst it was hoped that the defenders of humanity would know the best way to defend our way of life and fight for Managed Democracy, sadly this system of command and control has proven to be... temperamental...\nNever the less, the station's advantages make up for the flaws of it's commanders (and billions of super credits to operate). The station protected by hardened (but lightweight) alloy plating and armed with a suite of 77 PRESIDENTIAL-Class Cannons and of course it's Zero G Anti-Ship Missile System. The station also acts as a massive super-carrier, housing a massive fleet of Eagle fighters in an equally massive three-tiered Convocation Bay. No other ship in the Super Earth Navy can compete, although for the time being only one such battle station exists in the Galaxy, thus it's weaponry of mass liberation must be used sparingly.\nAuxiliary and civilian transports.\nOf course not every vessel put to the stars by humanity belongs to the Super Earth Navy, nor is everyone lucky enough to crew a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, pilot an &lt;a href=\"Eagle\"&gt;Eagle Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, or be assigned as one of the 1.3 million personnel aboard the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. As the great philosopher of Warfare Sun Tzu once said: \"The line between disorder and order lies in logistics.\"\nFoodstuffs to feed the hungry, materials to make implements of war and patriotic volunteers willing to throw themselves into the line of fire need to be transported around the galaxy somehow. Thus whilst it might not be as exciting as laying waste to an entire planet from low orbit, logistical craft are as much of a vital component to any military campaign as Super Destroyers, though rarely if ever do they get as much attention and hardly any glory.\nThe Super Earth Navy of course maintains it's own fleet of Faster than Light Capable military transports and lander, although the transport of militarily non-strategic cargo, civilians and cargo through space is still facilitated in non military transports -- particularly during planetary evacuations and the settling of new worlds.\nSuch civilian vessels are large, unarmed, unarmored and unprepared, making them vulnerable to attack by malicious forces who would seek to destroy or capture their valuable cargo. This further reinforces the importance of the navy's vital mission of keeping the the space lanes clear of the enemies of freedom and open for all traffic, military, commercial or otherwise.\nColonial Defense Forces.\nThe brave individuals of the colonies are given extensive military and survival training to further augment S.E.A.F. force projection. Every person, man, woman, child, and pet are expected to give their life without question in protecting Super Earth's legal holdings. To this end, the colonies of Super Earth possess their own security forces and colonial militias, funded in part by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, a well regulated planetary security force backed up by colonial militiamen would be able to wage a successful guerrilla war against enemy invaders thanks to their greater knowledge of the local terrain and the fact that the colonists would be fighting to defend their homes.\nHowever these security forces have proven insufficient in the current conflict, thus showing the barbarity and inhumanity of Super Earth's enemies. They are willing to kill voters who were equipped, within regulation, for the past one hundred years of peacetime for policing and protecting against wildlife. While well equipped with valor, the colonial security forces are nowhere near as well equipped or trained as the rest of S.E.A.F.\nDue to limited need in peacetime, budget cuts for many colonies have also pulled out what few teeth they still have, possibly contributing to swift fall of many planets near the start of the Second Galactic War. A prime example of this is the first defense of &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, where the spawning hordes of &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; easily overwhelmed the planet's colonial militias in a matter of hours. Even so, individual heroism has been noted among the colonial militia, with reports of Helldivers coming across dead citizens who managed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Devastators&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"SG-88%20Break-Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;double barrel shotguns&lt;/a&gt; and, in some cases, shovels.\nAs per S.E.A.F. policy, such valiant heroes will posthumously have their citizenship level raised and thus garner the right to have their name listed in the planetary death log (subject to Ministry of Truth regulations).\nSEAF Bug Wardens.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; are a threat that will infest the entire galaxy if not suppressed, they are also a rare and valuable species that is potentially an unlimited source of E-710 fuel for Super Earth. Outright extermination of the Terminids is counterproductive from both a logistical and moral perspective. Thus, after the defeat of the Bugs during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, they were confined to farms to be bred, raised, and harvested in order to produce E-710. This farming would last all through the Great Democratisation until February 8th, 2184. Billions of Terminids rose up and overran the Eastern sectors, marking one of the two starting events of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. While attempts were later made to introduce Terminids to safer, more free range farms, the fruits of these efforts have generally been mixed.\nWith the establishment of a Terminid Research Preserve on Acamar IV, past lessons learned from the failure of the Terminid Farms have been applied to guarantee the Preserve's security. The Terminids will to be allowed to develop naturally, but their population is monitored at all times by S.E.A.F. Wardens and encircled by electrical fencing, above and below ground. In the unlikely event of a containment breach, nuclear bombardments are set to automatically trigger. Research teams stationed within the Preserve will be able to requisition Terminid specimens as needed, aided by S.E.A.F. Bug Wardens.\nThe role of these wardens is to help enforce the Terminid's preservation as well as to manage and protect the various specimens within the Preserve. In the future, it is hoped that the Preserve can be expanded to provide not only research specimens, but also easy-to-acquire E-710. While these endeavors may present risks, it is necessary for the construction of the DSS and the long-term security of Managed Democracy itself.\nExcitingly, a small part of the Preserve has been allocated to the new \"Tyranny Park,\" where adventurous and well-paying citizens will be able to observe the Terminids in their natural environment. Some particularly bold patriots may even participate in a Big Tyrant Hunt. This exciting venture will help fund future research and deepen our citizens' understanding of the horrors of Tyranny.\nSEAF High Command.\nUnsurprisingly, Super Earth High Command stands as the primary command structure of the Super Earth Armed Forces. Headquartered on Super Earth and staffed by the most well connected greatest strategic minds from across the Federation, High Command's purpose is to direct the Super Earth Armed Forces to assure they meet the demands of Super Earth across the galaxy -- whether it be defending the freedom of words or launching campaigns to retake lost ground, it all has to start somewhere.\nBeing high up in the Super Earth food chain -- as the rank and file say -- High Command works in conjunction with the various &lt;a href=\"Ministries%20and%20Megacorporations\"&gt;Ministries and Megacorporations&lt;/a&gt; within the Federation who provide the administrative and logistical backbone of the Super Earth Armed Forces in the form of logistical, industrial, political, technological and administrative support. Primarily though, High Command reports to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;. The chain of command likely runs from the &lt;a href=\"President\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; to the Ministry of Defense, then to the various commanders of the combatant commands which make up the SEHC, including both famous wartime such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Brasch\"&gt;General Brasch&lt;/a&gt; and lesser known pencil pushers unproven but eager commanders just waiting to prove themselves.\nHigh Command has the authority to carry out exactly what needs to be done to defend Managed Democracy against the enemies of Super Earth and her people. To this end, during these times of war, High Command distributes &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;Major Orders&lt;/a&gt; to all forces within the S.E.A.F, setting major objectives that must be achieved. The Helldivers particularly are given the most critical orders and are demanded to accomplish these tasks, no matter the odds. Because of this, High Command often provides the Helldivers with (nearly) any piece of equipment needed to get the job done, including both mass manufactured classics and experimental armaments.\nAdditionally following intelligence and command failures following the Automaton Reclamation and fall of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; Line, High Command has started to more actively communicate with the Helldivers, providing the latest frontline intelligence from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Intelligence\"&gt;Ministry of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; through the galactic map and dispatches. After all, knowing is half the battle, the other being freedom and heavy ordinance...\nPossible SEAF Doctrine (speculation).\nDespite possessing deep manpower reserves and awesome firepower, S.E.A.F. forces are often &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;outnumbered&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;outgunned&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Illuminate\"&gt;outclassed&lt;/a&gt;, showing that continual sacrifice and military spending are required by Super Earth. This has resulted in Super Earth being slowly worn down and destroyed adopting a strategy of tactical advances to defensive lines away from the enemy in order to preserve its manpower and equipment.\nAlthough the exact doctrine of S.E.A.F. forces is unclear classified, one possible strategy employed is a \"Hammer and Scalpel\" doctrine that relies on cooperation between all branches, much like the Federation itself.\nThe Super Earth Army holds the frontlines, enduring the full might of enemy forces, whilst the Helldivers -- with orbital support from the Navy -- deploy deep behind enemy lines where they cripple key objectives, disrupt enemy logistics and cause general chaos. This gives the Army the chance to push forward and liberate some ground, increasing a planet's liberation progress. Once all enemy resistance has collapsed and all ground is taken, the planet will be officially liberated, with S.E.A.F. forces then transitioning to occupation, cleanup, and reconstruction operations in the aftermath.\nS.E.A.F. Soldiers.\nThe standard issue kit of most S.E.A.F. ground soldiers is not too dissimilar from those worn by the now defunct United Nations Peacekeepers, though unlike their distant ancestors, S.E.A.F. soldiers have real guns.\nOver the top of white-blue combat fatigues is worn a set of standard issue B-01 blue tactical armor, which provides basic protection from both pistol and rifle caliber bullets, as well as stab and slash attacks aimed at the chest. S.E.A.F. ground soldiers are also provided with a tactical belt with several pouches for storing ammunition and other items. Additional knee and thigh guards are worn for extra protection, as well as a fully enclosed combat helmet which can be worn alongside a set of protective goggles. Finally, the most important part of the standard issue kit is a pair of leather-nylon combat boots, which are an essential part of any S.E.A.F. soldier's uniform.\nThe Super Earth Armed Forces possess a vast arsenal of equipment, with the standard infantrymen being armed much like freshly defrosted Helldivers with standard issue &lt;a href=\"AR-23%20Liberator\"&gt;AR-23 Liberator&lt;/a&gt; Assault Rifle and a &lt;a href=\"P-2%20Peacemaker\"&gt;P-2 Peacemaker&lt;/a&gt; Sidearm as a backup weapon. Infantry squads will also sometimes contain specialists armed with heavier weapons such as sniper rifles, disposable rocket launchers and man portable rail-guns, although the &lt;a href=\"MG-43%20Machine%20Gun\"&gt;MG-43 Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the most common -- acting as the Squad Automatic Weapon.\nEven before the declaration of the Second Galactic War, S.E.A.F. soldiers were deployed in large numbers to protect remote S.E.A.F. facilities and colonies from enemy aggression. Unfortunately, while the S.E.A.F. overall is unbeatable (as mentioned previously), casualties for individual units are extremely high. Furthermore, the Helldivers primarily deploy behind enemy lines, and as such, the only S.E.A.F. soldiers that they are likely to find are those who have already given their lives for the defense of Super Earth.\nSEAF Training Facilities.\nFour &lt;a href=\"SEAF%20Training%20Facilities\"&gt;SEAF Training Facilities&lt;/a&gt; were built after the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Declaration%20of%20the%20Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Declaration of the Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt; and gave a 1.5% liberation boost. Although two of the facilities fell to the Automatons, the other two managed to survive until they were shut down on June 4th, taking the liberation boost with them."}

The primary role of the BT-1317 Bomber is to presumably drop bombs, launch torpedoes and deploy air-launched cruise missiles.\nWhilst the capabilities and official designation for this aircraft is unavailable due to none being assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver corps&lt;/a&gt; (yet). Some Helldivers have jokingly referred to it as the \"Albatross\" after noticing the similarities between it and the Pelican, usually after coming across the (rare) wreckage of the bomber crashed sparsely across enemy controlled planets.

After the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; on September 27th, 2184, Tarsh was turned into a DSS Logistics Hub.\nTopography.\nTarsh is now a Foggy Swamp planet, covered in endless expanses of mangrove trees that block Eagle-01's effective delivery of high-caliber democracy onto Super Earth's enemies, while the ground is riddled with vast extensions of muddy lakes and high amounts of shrubberies, roots and vegetation that slow down Helldivers.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation People's Shield.\nTarsh had been, ever since the start of the war against the Automatons, a solitary planet, cut off the rest of the Marspira Sector as its Colonial Overseer saw the incoming threat from nearby Aesir Pass and &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;. As the months passed, Tarsh would remain in a type of tense, fragile peace, as the Automatons inched ever closer to the Marspira Sector until, in August 17th, Tarsh's peace would be taken from it.\nAfter successfully punching into neighboring Curia in August 11th, the Automatons would then restore the FTL line to Tarsh and launched a massive onslaught, in their desperate push towards Super Earth. However, the Automatons wouldn't count with the Helldivers' superior military strategy, as the Helldivers would capture Curia on August 18th, only a day after their initial push into Tarsh. The Automaton offensive would be forced to withdraw back to Vernen Wells that day.\nHowever, this would not be the end of Tarsh's problems as the Automatons that survived would withdraw to Vernen Wells and, on August 20th, sent a second assault onto Tarsh through a newly formed FTL line connecting Vernen Wells and Tarsh, while also launching an assault onto neighboring Curia in a desperate attempt to hold on to their vanguard at the Marspira Sector.\nOperation Critical Mass.\nThough primarily focused towards the Terminid containment zone on the eastern front, the secondary objective for Operation Critical Mass was the Automaton-controlled planets Tarsh and &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; as both contain significant manufactories producing polystyrene foam, an important precursor to napalm. If both planets could be liberated within the duration of the operation, it would be possible to immediately roll out the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Napalm%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Napalm Barrage&lt;/a&gt; for fleetwide acquisition. While the reduction of the Terminid population demanded critical attention, many helldivers saw the acquisition of these planets and their critical facilities as being more important for the long-term war effort.\nInitially progress on Tarsh would be slow, with the majority of &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;SEAF&lt;/a&gt;'s focused on the neighboring desert planet of Mastia. However following its liberation on the 15th of September, 2184, Helldivers would gain access to the orbital napalm barrages now that the planet's polystyrene foam manufactories were under federation control. Moreover, Tarsh was cutoff from all adjacent Automaton systems, and their resistance crumbled as a result! While the isolated bots on Tarsh fought fiercely, they couldn\u2019t hold off the Helldivers, bringing the planet back into Liberty\u2019s warm embrace, and unlocking the Orbital Napalm Barrage fleet-wide.\n&lt;a href=\"Helldiver%20Operations\"&gt;Operation Leap Forward&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Helldivers have managed to retake &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; from the Automatons' clutches, securing an ideal construction site for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, A DSS Logistics Hub would be set up on Tarsh to manage the massive amount of resources and manpower which would be needed in the battle station's construction.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nSince its final liberation in September, Tarsh would have seen pretty much zero attacks, allowing the DSS Logistics work to perform its duties without much interruption. However, this peace was not guaranteed, as Vernen Wells stood nearby with the Automaton Vanguard still waiting. The situation would only worsen when, in October, the Jet Brigade would take over Matar Bay and Martale before the Helldivers could put a temporary stop to them. As the DSS neared completion, the Automatons began to relocate the remnants of the Jet Brigade and, following their failed attempts of expansion, began to rebuild the Jet Brigade.\nBy November 11th, the writing was on the wall. The Automatons had rebuilt the nefarious special force and were preparing to take over Tarsh and, after it, Gaellivare, in a last ditch attempt to destroy the Democracy Space Station.\nOn the afternoon of November 11th, Tarsh would send an urgent emergency distress signal, reporting the presence of the Jet Brigade and at least 58 Automaton Battalions, the single biggest enemy onslaught faced in the war so far, even surpassing the Terminid Superonslaught faced in &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; in August 6th, 2184.\nThe main Helldiver fleet turned up on Tarsh immediately, decided to inflict as many casualties on the Jet Brigade's numbers as possible, in hopes of ultimately inflicting enough damage to allow for the strike force's defeat on a later defense. The remaining garrisons of the Colonial Defense and what little civilian stragglers had been left behind would be joined by almost every Helldiver there was in the corps, fighting shoulder to shoulder to keep the robotic tide at bay as desperate evacuations of important personnel were made.\nBut despite the immense courage and bravery, the Automatons had come in plenty of numbers towards the marshy planet. Tarsh would fall on November 12th, but not after an acceptable number of high-value personnel was evacuated. While the DSS Logistics Hub was destroyed, the facility had fulfilled its purpose and was of no more use. However, through its capture, the Automatons had pinpointed the location of the Democracy Space Station at Gaellivare and began to rally their forces in preparation for an advance towards it."}

The TCS would be constructed on an unbroken line of barrier planets in the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;, with the plan being to quarantine the bugs behind them.\nActivation of the Terminid Control System.\nAfter the bugs were pushed back to the barrier planets, where after weeks of work SEAF engineers had finished a building a network of massive, Termicide-dispensing towers upon each Barrier Planet: the key to the Terminid Control System. Once activated, the TCS would exterminate every Terminid on that planet, and inoculate it against all future infestations. However, surges in Terminid activity also forced the SEAF Engineers to evacuate, with the Helldivers being sent in to activate the Terminid Control System at any cost.\nThe Terminid Control System would later be successfully and fully activated several days later thanks to the efforts of the Helldivers. The Termicide would work as intended, killing millions of Terminids on the Barrier Planets. Super Earth's citizens could finally rest easy, knowing their children were forever safe from being eaten alive by fascist insects.\nHowever unconfirmed reports, antidemocratic rumors and unpatriotic conspiracy theories say that the Termicide, an Anti-Terminid Neurotoxin dispersed by the TCS Towers, is causing the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; to mutate and evolve faster. These rumors and conspiracy theories are all slanderous and defamatory, and most of all untrue, and any Helldivers or Citizens that is caught in the act of spouting such rumors must be reported to your nearest &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Officer\"&gt;Democracy Officer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nFor around two months the Terminid Control System worked as intended, even proving key during Operation Enduring Bulwark by providing a solid barrier against further Terminid advances into federation space.\nHowever after two months, the TCS started to no longer functioning as intended as Terminid outbreaks erupted on all &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;. Most shockingly of all however was that the bugs were displaying resistance to Termicide! Something our top scientists previously believed impossible. Not only that but situation on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, Terminid reproduction exploded overnight, and continues to increase exponentially, with the planet almost fully infested within hours.\nWhilst the exact mechanism for this hyper-reproductive adaptation is unknown, it appears to be linked to continued Termicide Exposure. Whilst this effect is still limited to &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot be allowed to spread. With the situation on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; is unsalvagable, High Command placed Operation Legitimate Undertaking on indefinite hiatus. whilst the Helldivers were ordered to immediately deactivate the Terminid Control System on the remaining Barrier Planets.\nDecommissioning and aftermath.\nFurther calamity has been thankfully averted, thanks to the swift and disciplined response of the Helldivers to deactivate the remaining Terminid Control System nodes. With further Termicide disbursement arrested, the remaining Barrier Planets are safe from suffering Meridia's fate.\nAdditionally the cause of the TCS failure has been identified. The Termicide had functioned as expected, killing nearly 100% of all Terminids (and 0% of absolutely any other biological life). However, for the small fraction of Terminids that survived, exposure to non-lethal doses of Termicide eventually caused beneficial changes to gene expression, in a completely unprecedented process known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis\"&gt;hormesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn most Barrier Planets, this adaptation was limited to increased Termicide resistance, but on Meridia, non-lethal Termicide exposure caused higher reproduction rates and reduced generation time, with continued exposure to Termicide perpetuating this effect. The planet is now infested to a degree nearly comparable with the Terminid home planet, and scientists have classified &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; as a \"Supercolony\".\nThe infestation is so severe that conventional Helldiver operations on the planet are out of the question. Currently the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; is hard at work on a solution, but in the meantime, the Meridian Supercolony is likely to accelerate the spread of the Terminids in unforeseeable ways.\nRest assured, the reckless scientists responsible for created the Termicide are being thoroughly investigated. With the TCS inoperable and this new Supercolony active, the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; are now a greater threat than ever before. However there may yet be hope as following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry of Science has announced that it is working on a new variant of Termicide (Termicide 2.0) which promises to be even more deadly..."}

The size of the nests will change depending on the difficulty along with the enemy types capable of being deployed from the nests' emergence holes.\nBug hole.\nBug holes are the object of interest at each nest. As demonstrated in the &lt;a href=\"Tutorial%20mission\"&gt;Tutorial mission&lt;/a&gt;, Terminids will periodically emerge from these structures, gathering into patrols that will search for Helldivers and civilians.\nThe angled shape of these structures limit attack options to explosives such as grenades or ordnance. Grenades must be thrown directly into the hole. Impact explosives such as from the &lt;a href=\"AC-8%20Autocannon\"&gt;AC-8 Autocannon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"R-36%20Eruptor\"&gt;R-36 Eruptor&lt;/a&gt; must make contact with the brightly glowing minerals lining the hole's interior. Bombs and orbital strikes can destroy holes through their sheer explosive power. In desperate times, Hellpods can also be used to plug holes, with a small risk of the Hellpod's contents being stuck below ground.\nTiers.\nAt the Low tier of difficulties (1\u20133), small holes will spawn fodder types such as &lt;a href=\"Scavenger\"&gt;Scavenger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Spitter\"&gt;Spitter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Pouncer\"&gt;Pouncer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Middle tier of difficulties (4\u20136), will usually spawn soldier types, such as &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Guard\"&gt;Hive Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s \nAt the High tier of difficulties (7\u20139), large holes will deploy any of the previously mentioned units while also deploying elite types, such as Charger variants.\nThe Final tier, Super Helldive (10), introduces a new type of nest simply known as the Mega-Hive. Capable of deploying every existing Terminid ground unit, excluding Stalkers.\nIdentifying.\nLarger nests are easier to identify due to the oily rock like structures built around the nests, these nests will be surrounded by green fog which may be easily blend into foggy combat zones. \nNests can be identified by the orange pheromones exhausted from the emergence holes. It is easier to identify small nests due to the more circular/crescent moon shape of their nests.\nIf on combat zones that have intense spore coverage, utilization of &lt;a href=\"Objectives%23Tactical%20Objectives\"&gt;SEAF Radar Stations&lt;/a&gt; is recommended for proper identification of nests. If no such assets are available then utilizing a runner to ping nests is the best alternative.\nStructure Types.\nSmall: Small Terminid nests are lightly fortified locations and usually have 1-3 emergence holes that will primarily spawn scavengers, pouncers, and bile spitters. They will often have a small pack of defenders, usually including a lone hunter and a pack of fodder. Rarely on higher difficulties will a charger be aiding in the protection of a small nest.\nMedium: Medium Terminid nests are more fortified and usually have up to 4-7 emergence holes that spawn fodder types to warrior types. The primary defenders of Medium nests will often be hunters, warriors, and hive guards supported by a small pack of fodder. On higher difficulties, one or two chargers may also be protecting the nest. Bug holes on medium nests generally open towards the center, requiring a circuit around the nest's rim, or entering the bowl of the nest.\nLarge: Large Terminid Nests are massive fortified areas brimming with Terminids with more powerful types guarding them. Usually loaded with on average 10 emergence holes. While the previously seen types make up the bulk of the Large nests guard, hive guards, brood commanders, and chargers will also be protecting the Nest. On higher difficulties even Impalers may be aiding in defending the nest. Inside large nests, bug holes start to open in random directions, with many obstacles in the way, forcing more thorough paths to clear.\nMega: Mega nests are the largest type of nest discovered so far. Immensely fortified and brimming with Terminids, these nests have at the maximum of 13 emergence holes, it is unknown if Helldivers have been able to report there being more or not. The nest is surrounded by towering walls, several large packs of Terminids patrolling and standing idle in and around the nest. In the center of the nest is a &lt;a href=\"Currencies%23Samples\"&gt;Mutated Egg&lt;/a&gt; nestled within the dead husk of a Bile titan. \nStrategy.\nThe safest method to destroy them is by using an Eagle Airstrike as it will also clear out any chaff spawning, Alternative methods include the &lt;a href=\"EAT-17%20Expendable%20Anti-Tank\"&gt;EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GR-8%20Recoilless%20Rifle\"&gt;GR-8 Recoilless Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;LAS-99 Quasar Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AC-8%20Autocannon\"&gt;AC-8 Autocannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RL-77%20Airburst%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GL-21%20Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;GL-21 Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MLS-4X%20Commando\"&gt;MLS-4X Commando&lt;/a&gt; are effective weapons to use against them as one shot from each will destroy a single bug hole. &lt;a href=\"Grenades%20%28Helldivers%202%29\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; are also a viable choice, preferably standard grenade types. Special Grenade types will not work.\nStratagems such as the several &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Airstrike\"&gt;Eagle Airstrike&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20380MM%20HE%20Barrage\"&gt;Orbital Barrages&lt;/a&gt; can also make short work of them in close proximity. A runner can be assigned to deliver the stratagem while the remaining teammates provide cover.\nClearing a nest is a risky endeavor, as dozens of Terminids can spawn en masse and overwhelm Helldivers in the vicinity if not quick enough. Reinforcements and patrols from neighboring nests only add to the difficulty.\nSpecial Nests.\nCertain types of Terminids spawn only from dedicated nests:"}

The Terminids have been identified as \"Fascist\" by , despite the individual Terminid being incapable of comprehending ideology. As a whole they engage in fascism with their violent atrocities against the citizenry of Super Earth and with their undemocratic power structure.\nGalactic Geography.\nThe Terminids infest six sectors, &lt;a href=\"L%27estrade%20Sector\"&gt;L'estrade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sten%20Sector\"&gt;Sten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi&lt;/a&gt;. They have also previously infested three other sectors, the &lt;a href=\"Orion%20Sector\"&gt;Orion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut&lt;/a&gt;,and &lt;a href=\"Borgus%20Sector\"&gt;Borgus Sectors&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Terminids reside in the Eastern side of the Galaxy stretching from &lt;a href=\"Diaspora%20X\"&gt;Diaspora X&lt;/a&gt; in the North to &lt;a href=\"Gar%20Haren\"&gt;Gar Haren&lt;/a&gt; in the South. The Terminids have mostly stayed in the same place in the Galaxy since February, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; who went further north during the Reclamation. After the activation of the Terminid Control System, a state of back and forth was created in the &lt;a href=\"Mirin%20Sector\"&gt;Mirin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draco%20Sector\"&gt;Draco Sectors&lt;/a&gt; through late March and April and was only ended after the failure of the Terminid Control System and the creation of the Meridia Supercolony. The Orion Sector was invaded for the first time since March with Terminid spores reaching all the way to &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt; was also attacked for the first time in history with Terminids reaching as far as &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Enduring Peace and the destruction of the Meridia Supercolony seemed to put things back to what they were before the Terminid Control System failed, but FTL lines to the &lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20Sector\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sectors&lt;/a&gt; on June 18th and 20th changed that. Now, no sector was safe from the Terminids. Another worrying event conducted by the Terminds was the attack on &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;, as it was attacked by the Bugs without a FTL line connecting to it. This is still unexplained to this day but Gatria would be retaken on July 11th.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Escalation%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Escalation of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; initiative would shake up the Terminid front dramatically with a Termind Spore cloud called &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt; appearing around &lt;a href=\"Enuliale\"&gt;Enuliale&lt;/a&gt;, then continuing to expand exponentially until August 27th, where growth has remained stagnant ever since.\nThe homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Kepler%20Prime\"&gt;Kepler Prime&lt;/a&gt; is missing from the Galactic Map, probably because it is uninhabitable due to Super Earth's bombardment of the planet.\nHistory.\nTransition from Bug to Terminid.\nAfter the defeat of the Bugs during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, the Bugs were confined to farms and bred, raised, and harvested to produce E-710. This, along with Super Earth conducting tests on them, forever altered the biology of the Bugs, making them more spindly and creating a toxic version of E-710 called Bile. Now solely a biological source of spaceship fuel, the Bugs were re-named to the Terminids. This farming would last all through the Great Democratisation until February 2184, when billions of Terminids would rise up and overrun the Eastern sectors, marking one of the two starting events of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;Second Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Valiant%20Enclosure\"&gt;Operation Valiant Enclosure&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn retaliation to the Terminid outbreaks and &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; incursions, the Helldivers were re-mobilised to numbers not seen since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;. The newly recruited Helldivers were immediately issued Operation Valiant Enclosure, a multiphase operation to contain the growing Terminids by using a network of towers called the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;, or the TCS, to spray Termicide, a chemical that can efficiently kill an entire planet's Terminid population in just a few hours. The location of the TCS was decided to be on the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Barrier Planets&lt;/a&gt;, a line of four worlds occupied by the Bugs. To reach the Umlaut Sector the Helldivers were ordered to take &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;. Both were taken by February 14th, but surprise Automaton attacks into the &lt;a href=\"Xzar%20Sector\"&gt;Xzar Sector&lt;/a&gt; put Operation Valiant Enclosure on hold until a Terminid outbreak on &lt;a href=\"Veld\"&gt;Veld&lt;/a&gt; threatened to derail all effort on the front. The outbreak was crushed with ease within a day, but the Terminid attacks on &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; pushed the S.E.A.F.'s efforts out of the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, on March 12th, S.E.A.F. High Command issued the activation of the Terminid Control System, which would finally rid the Terminids for centuries to come, blocking them behind an impassable wall of Termicide. Over four days, brave engineers and Helldivers worked day and night to rid the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt; from the Terminid Horde, and on March 15th, all TCS towers in the Sector were activated, culling 99.6% of all Terminids across all four planets.\nWith the end of Operation Valiant Enclosure and creation of the Terminid Control System, the S.E.A.F. continued their liberation of Terminid territory in Operation Prime Liberation and Operation CBCT Protection. During this operation, on March 21st, an evolution among the ranks of Terminids was confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Intelligence\"&gt;Ministry of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. These Terminids are capable of flying, and were named &lt;a href=\"Shrieker\"&gt;Shriekers&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the Terminids forced Spore Spewers and Shrieker Nests to develop augmented protection against grenades and small explosive munitions.\n&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia Supercolony&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the early mutations, the Terminid Control System continued to work well until the Termicide itself failed. Through a novel process called \"hormesis\", the Terminids managed to not only develop resistance to the Termicide but, even worse, managed to use it to dramatically increase their reproductive pace, getting such a boost that they managed to transform Meridia into a Supercolony in April of 2184.\nFrom April to June, this Terminid supercolony managed to wreak havoc all over the Eastern Sectors until, on June 2nd, Meridia was destroyed through the use of the Dark Fluid in order to re-stabilize the Terminid front.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gloom appeared on August 6th, 2184, around the vicinity of the planet Enuliale, which had fallen during the initial February outbreak. It is a mysterious nebula composed of extremely high concentrations of intergalactic Terminid spores, which are spore clouds that are capable of getting across the emptiness of space and can provoke Terminid outbreaks wherever they go.\nLittle is known about the Gloom, as all attempts to study it have ended in failure, been sabotaged, or have yielded little results.\nFrom the Gloom sprang up old Terminid variants, such as the Impalers, which were first re-discovered on August 6th, 2184 during the defense of &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; against the first and so far, largest, ever Terminid Super Onslaught.\nPower Structure.\nWhen outside the safety of Super Earth's E-710 farms, Terminids form a crude, fascistic hierarchy based around a particular Terminid's genetic composition. Certain Terminids, such as the Brood and Alpha Commanders, seem to be able to give rudimentary commands to other Terminids through pheromones. This command is fragile, however, as bugs will often lose all control and formation when in the presence of Helldivers and attack mindlessly.\nRegardless, it can be noticed that certain bugs, such as the Bile Titan and Impaler, are the most elite amongst the Terminid horde, as they often patrol alone if they ever happen to spawn naturally at a Nest or Minor Point of Interest.\nFactions.\nTerminids.\nThe resemble gigantic bug creatures with deadly adaptations and instincts. In contrast to , almost all Terminids use their claws to inflict damage on Helldivers, with a few exceptions in the form of units that possess long-range attacks. As such, Terminids will attempt to rapidly close distance and surround Helldivers, resulting in most battles being conducted at close range and compelling Helldivers to try and gain distance from bugs. Close-range and crowd-control equipment will be the most effective against the Terminid Horde.\nTerminid Biology and Morphology.\nTerminids are a species of extraterrestrial insectoids, sharing many similarities with arthropods native to Earth, such as multiple limbs, insect-like mandibles, and an exoskeleton. Terminid hives rely heavily on spores, as they are present near every Terminid hive structure. This suggests that Terminids are either two separate species, one animal and one fungal working in a symbiotic relationship, or a single animal-like species capable of producing fungal-like spores. The existence of very fungal structures made to produce either &lt;a href=\"Spore%20Spewer\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shrieker%20Nest\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; further complicates their relationship.\nTerminids are descendants of the fought in the First Galactic War. However, they are considerably different, probably due to either large-scale genetic alteration by &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Super%20Earth\"&gt;Super Earth&lt;/a&gt; or heavy mutation from confined populations. Sometime before or during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Galactic%20War\"&gt;First Galactic War&lt;/a&gt;, Super Earth discovered that dead bug bodies decay into an oil-like substance which they named Element 710, the pursuit of which ensured that peace would never be an option.\nWith the end of the First Galactic War, the Bugs were put onto specific planets to farm them for Element 710. Super Earth then proceeded to perform genetic experiments on Terminids to increase their Element 710 production and possibly create new breeds. This experimentation resulted in the body chemistry of some Terminids becoming highly unstable, producing massive amounts of a highly acidic substance called \"Bile\". This resulted in the creation of the Bile breed, a species that can spew the corrosive acid at their targets. Other mutations resulting from this experimentation include &lt;a href=\"Bile%20Titan\"&gt;gigantism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stalker\"&gt;near invisibility&lt;/a&gt;."}

Ever since, it had remained disconnected alongside its neighbor Azterra, as the war came and went from their sector between the initial outbreak, the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Supercolony Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the apparition of &lt;a href=\"The%20Gloom\"&gt;The Gloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Terrek was unable to completely subsist on its own. Given its barren, lunar conditions and constant meteor showers, it was a matter of time before it ran out of supplies, as its greenhouse farms could not sustain long-term population growth for the colonies.\nAs such, on November 6th, 2184, it reconnected itself into the FTL Network, restoring its FTL Line to Azterra, as well as connecting itself with Cirrus and Bore Rock. Unfortunately, this move would come at a very poor time, as the Terminids had begun an offensive aided by a spore surge coming right out of the Gloom.\nWith the Democracy Space Station nearing completion, Terrek was chosen as one of three processing sites from which colonists displaced from their homeworlds by the Gloom would then be relocated into the DSS as its permanent staff. Given this situation, Terrek, alongside with Cirrus and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, were designated as protection targets for the Major Order. However, since the Terminids never got to any planets connected to Terrek, it wouldn't see any need for protection, allowing its colonists to continue their daily democratic lives in unimpeded freedom"}

The interstellar spore cloud has continued to grow at an unprecedented rate, now encompasses several star systems, and is growing more every day.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; are known to send spores between planetary space, nothing of this magnitude has been previously seen. Genetic analysis indicates a possible connection of &lt;a href=\"Impaler\"&gt;new Terminids&lt;/a&gt; to the interstellar spores. Additionally, following the end of Operation Lighthouse, it has also been noted that the spores also accelerate the spread of &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; to planets in its vicinity.\nEfforts are underway to determine the source and nature of this threat new. Analysis of spores from &lt;a href=\"Socorro%20III\"&gt;Socorro III&lt;/a&gt; show a genetic connection to samples from The Gloom, indicating that it may have been the source of these new Terminids. The expansion of the cloud will likely spread these new Terminid variants to other planets within its vicinity. Furthermore All vessels sent into the Gloom, both manned and unmanned, have ceased radio contact within minutes. None have returned. Thus Super Earth is left with but one remaining course. The &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; must procure samples of Terminid organic matter from the planets closest to the Gloom.\nUnfortunately whilst Operation Prometheus was completed much sooner than expected, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Earth%20Armed%20Forces%23SEAF%20High%20Command\"&gt;Super Earth High Command&lt;/a&gt; soon detected a large batch of counterfeit samples within the delivery of the last Major Order. As is customary, Medals were awarded to all Helldivers who honorably performed their duties, whilst the ones who submitting false samples have had their pet fish summarily executed. &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; all across Super Earth space are attempting to filter out the false samples, but the expected scientific advances to combat the spread of The Gloom have decreased significantly.\nWith efforts to research the growing Terminid spore cloud hamstrung by sorting counterfeit from genuine samples, Super Earth scientists discovered little of use to restrict its growth. By the 21st of August, the cloud encompassed nearly a dozen systems, and showed no sign of slowing. If it continued at this rate, the entire galaxy would be consumed in a matter of weeks. Even so the Super Earth Armed Forces would not allow a mere lack of scientific understanding to thwart decisive action by deploying every weapon in it's arsenal. The source and nature of the Gloom may not be clear, but the mass extermination of its tyrannical spawn will send a clear message to the mindless bugs: Freedom will not be intimidated.\nOperation Brute Force would see Helldivers exterminating massive swaths of Terminids, including the largest tyrants amongst them. Notably the growth of the Gloom seemed to have slowed with the Helldiver show of Force Freedom proving highly effective, intimidating the mindless insects into ceasing the spread of their malevolent, impenetrable cloud for the time being."}

Though much of the worlds industry had been moved off world, the destruction of the remaining factories on the planet forced the enemy to distribute their existing forces more thinly, lowering their planetary resistance (from 1.5% to 0.5%). This would be the beginning of the end for the Automatons, with the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin Sector&lt;/a&gt; being fully liberated a day later. Out of an abundance of caution, SEAF teams would search what remains of Automaton facilities and servers for any additional intelligence, right up until the surprise invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lacaille%20Sector\"&gt;Lacaille Sector&lt;/a&gt; several days later."}

Unfortunately, on March 7, 2184, the socialist Automaton menace launched a surprise attack, seizing Tien Kwan shortly before fleetwide deployment of the Exosuits. High Command immediately ordered the liberation of the planet, knowing that failure to act would result in the discovery and destruction of the Exosuits. \nThanks to the swift liberation of Tien Kwan, the Morgunson Arsenal was returned to Super Earth control. Its stockpile of freshly-produced Exosuits was recovered intact, with them becoming available for immediate requisition throughout the SEAF."}

{"id": "3033", "revid": "54944075", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3033", "title": "Training", "text": "Helldivers is a top-down twin-stick shooter video game, and the training is an essential tool for new players to learn the basic mechanics and controls of the game. In this article, we'll go over the topics covered in the training in the order they appear. The training is split up into three parts: Basic, Advanced and a Simulated mission\nBasic Training.\nBeing Downed\nThe first topic covered in the training is being downed. In the game, when your character's health reaches zero, they will fall to the ground. While downed, you can move your character and use your sidearm, but you will gradually bleed out. To get back up, you can spam the action button or have another player help you up. If you die, you will respawn immediately in single player as long as you have auto reinforcements available, and in multiplayer, a player must call you back in with the stratagem.\nAmmo Boxes\nAmmo boxes are the second topic covered in the training. When you run out of ammo for your weapons, you can replenish it by approaching an ammo box and pressing the button. Note that ammo boxes only replenish your ammo, not stratagems.\nReloading\nReloading is the third topic covered in the training. To reload your weapon, simply press the reload button. The reload time will vary depending on the weapon you are using.\nShooting\nShooting is the fourth topic covered in the training. You can shoot your weapon by pressing the right trigger.\nAiming\nAiming is the fifth topic covered in the training. To aim your weapon, you can use the right stick. Note that the game has a laser sight equipped by default that appears when you aim, but you cannot zoom in. Additionally, the tutorial covers weak points, which can be targeted for maximum damage.\nGrenades\nGrenades are the sixth topic covered in the training. You can throw a grenade by pressing the left bumper. The distance the grenade travels is determined by how long you hold the button down. You can carry a maximum of two grenades at once, and there is only one type available in the tutorial.\nSidearms\nSidearms are the seventh topic covered in the training. In the game, you can switch to your sidearm by pressing the switch weapons button. The tutorial covers using the sidearm to avoid killing players nearby.\nSprinting\nSprinting is the eighth topic covered in the training. To sprint, you can push in the left stick.\nGoing Prone\nGoing prone is the final topic covered in the training. You can go prone by pressing the square button, which will protect you from friendly gunfire, but you will be unable to use any weapons while in this position.\nThis completes the basic section and will enable you to move onto the advanced training.\nAdvanced Training.\nThe advanced section is based around the use of Stratagems.\nStratagems in Helldivers are powerful support abilities that players can call in during a mission. They are activated by holding the left bumper and inputting a code, followed by throwing the stratagem.\nThe stratagems shown in the training are as follows:\nResupply Stratagem\nThe Resupply Stratagem is a support stratagem that calls in an ammo box to the player's location. This can be used to refill the player's ammunition during a mission.\nDive Bomb Stratagem\nThe Dive Bomb Stratagem is an offensive stratagem that calls in a powerful bomb from the sky, capable of dealing significant damage to enemies.\nMinigun Turret Stratagem\nThe Minigun Turret Stratagem is a defensive stratagem that calls in a minigun turret. Players must be prone to deploy this stratagem, as the turret may cause friendly fire if deployed while standing.\nStratagems have a limited number of uses and are replenished between missions.\nAuto Reinforcements\nIn single player, Auto Reinforcements are available. The number of auto reinforcements is increased with each objective completed. In multiplayer, if a player dies, it is up to the rest of the squad to call the Reinforcements stratagem to bring back all dead players, including themselves if they throw the stratagem upon death.\nthis completes the advanced section and will enable you to move onto a example version of a mission\nSimulated Helldiver Mission.\nThe simulated mission is a training exercise that allows players to experience a real Helldiver mission in a controlled environment. This section will walk players through the objectives and challenges they may encounter during an actual mission. The objectives are to blow up a bug nest with a Hellbomb and extract. Players will encounter unique robotic enemies - they don't appear in any other section of the game - that use lethal stun weapons to kill the players. This section will also cover the use of maps and tactical movement aswell the collectible samples; the collected samples in the training, however, won't be added to the sample count in the main game. The simulated mission provides a valuable opportunity for players to hone their skills and practice the techniques they have learned in the training before embarking on real missions."}

Since the planet was located on edge of Super Earth space, help was not able to arrive on time during initial chaos, leaving it forsaken by freedom...or so it seemed. \nOperation Overrun (September 2nd-3rd, 2184).\nTrandor would remain in Terminid claws until an incursion from this direction was detected into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt;. After the attacks were quickly repelled, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Science\"&gt;Ministry of Science&lt;/a&gt; begun calculating optimal FTL paths that could be used by Super Destroyers. \nThe following day, by the time calculations have been finalized, another attack arrived from this world into &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt;. Pre-emptive scans from present Super Destroyers on orbit indicated one of greatest concentrations of Terminid interstellar spores up to date. It is suspected the attack from day before was simply a form of Terminid Vanguard. \nNevertheless, with the second attack repelled just like the first one, the first Super Destroyers began to deploy on Trandor, finding it to be, just like Omicron before it, left unspoiled by the Terminid plague despite months of occupation. With the knowledge gained from the failed L'estrade Expeditions, the Helldivers began the slow march towards Trandor's liberation. \nOperation Critical Mass.\nThe Battle for Trandor was a slow, grueling process. The Helldivers turned every rock, uprooted every shrubbed and searched every tree, preserving the beauties of this perennial planet while purging its fascist infestation, baptizing Trandor into a new life of Freedom under the stewardship of the Federation.\nHowever, during this process, the Terminids that remained hidden in Trandor made one final attempt at saving their tyrannical appendages from complete democratization. On September 11th, they would launch yet another assault onto Gatria. This assault could not have been more poorly timed; as the Helldivers, having explicit orders to cull the number of Terminid Warriors and Bile Spewers, would make a full display of Super Earth's military might, delivering some of the highest caliber Liberty available onto the assaulting Terminids, completely wiping them out in just 12 hours.\nThis assault would seal the fate of Trandor's parasitic totalitarians, as now they had not only exposed themselves to the Helldivers already in Trandor.\nThey had also depleted the bulk of Trandor's Terminid Hives.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nWith the Terminid Hatcheries in Trandor nowhere near ready, the Helldivers would deploy en masse onto the perennial planet, seeking to put an end to Gatria's terror, avenge the lost citizens from the initial outbreak, but most important of all, make Trandor be born anew into the light of Liberty as a prosperous planet colony of Super Earth.\nFor 3 days, the Helldivers battled on Trandor, struggling at first due to logistical challenges related to the liberation of Pandion and certain defeats in the Automaton Front.\nThen, on September 21st, 2184, Trandor's last Terminid was appropriately cleansed in Liberty-blessed Napalm and Caustic Gas, as the Helldivers liberated a planet in the Sten Sector for the first time since the start of the war, sending a clear message to those that supported Super Earth and to its enemies, both bug and bot alike: That Liberty Prevails Once More.\nOperation Ring of Freedom.\nTrandor would remain free for 2 weeks, as the first colonists arrived to Trandor. However, they wouldn't even be able to begin pitching their sufficiently sized dwelling units before the Terminids went to snatch their new homes away from them. On October 11th, the Terminids sent an assault onto Trandor. However, it would not receive much Helldiver assistance, as other planets in the Jin Xi sector had been designated as Major Order targets, which pretty much doomed Trandor into oblivion, leaving it undefended and leading to its fall on October 12th."}

{"id": "3453", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3453", "title": "Troost", "text": "Troost is one of the five planets that reside within the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;. The planet once housed an automaton long-range communications array, the capture of which would reveal critical intelligence about the enemy's plans.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Expeditions.\nTroost had been a peaceful planet colony of Super Earth for at least 100 years, without any happenings of note occurring before 2184 as its colonists toiled happily among the ashen trees and parasitic flowers. However, the Automatons were only programmed to hate things such as peace and freedom and, as such, launched a cowardly attack upon Troost. On February, a massive Automaton force would invade the Western Galactic Rim and take over many planets in the Xzar and Severin Sectors, Troost being among the first to fall.\nThe colonial defenses fought hard, but were no match for the robotic tide that fell onto them. Shortly after making planetfall, the Automatons would occupy Troost and install an abominable communications array to further spread their mechanized horror across the Severin Sector.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nFollowing the successful liberation of Troost during the first phase of operation Swift Disassembly, the Automaton communications array was decommissioned. Strangely however, it appeared that the array was broadcasting outside of the Galactic Frontier. Super Earth's intelligence analysts salvaged what they could to determine more, but unfortunately much of the data was already deleted.\nOne transmission that was salvaged however did contain the blueprints for a new Automaton type: &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;aerial gunships&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to this advanced warning, the hardworking factory laborers of Super Earth were able to accelerate production of new anti-air weapons.\nOnly weeks after the liberation of Troost was it discovered that the Automatons were communicating with their main fleet, which was preparing a surprise invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nWhat many failed to realize at the time was that Troost was a warning for what was to come. Nevertheless, the Helldivers carried on with their righteous quest for freedom, crushing the Automaton forces after a decisive battle at &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. However, this would not be the last Super Earth would see of the robots.\nA mere 3 days after their victory, the Automatons would return en masse, with a force 10 times larger than the one encountered prior. They would swiftly conquer Cyberstan and the Valdis Sector and then began to invade all the adjacent planets.\nAs the Helldivers scrambled back towards the Automaton front, the robots' advance would be halted at the Menkent-Lesath line, forcing them to search for a flank through Marfark, which would fail. After failing to flank the Menkent Line, the Automatons turned West and South, their aims refocused on regaining their old lands.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nAs the months progressed, the Automatons inched towards the Xzar sector more and more, one planet at a time, getting closer and closer to Troost. It wouldn't be long before they then captured &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the Severin Sector, now through the planets that they hadn't touched before. While the Helldivers managed to secure victories in the Severin Sector, such as the destruction of the Petafactory and the capturing of Database One, the Automatons continued to push into the Severin sector nevertheless, eventually retaking &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; and then, on June 9th, Ustotu. Then, on June 22nd, the Automaton force on Ustotu launched an assault onto Vandalon IV then began to launch assaults into the Xzar Sector, prompting the SEAF to redirect all their forces towards it in order to prevent the Automatons from regaining Malevelon Creek.\nWhile the Automatons were successfully repelled, they would consolidate their defenses and capture Troost on June 25th, putting it under their control once more.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nHowever, the Automatons at Troost would not get to enjoy the recovery of their old communications array. Some weeks after the lockdown of the Xzar sector, the Helldivers would manage to score a number of key victories that culminated in Operation Andromeda, which severed the Automaton front in half. As June and August passed, the robot territories west of Cyberstan would be slowly and methodically recovered by Super Earth, with the only setback being the delayed liberation of &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the failure of Operation Liberty Crush.\nBy August 10th, Troost and Vandalon IV stood as the only remaining vestiges of the Automaton presence in the Western Galactic Rim. As such, the Helldivers were ordered to put an end to this pocket of mechanized tyranny and socialism. After Vandalon IV was liberated on August 12th, the Helldivers would immediately redirect towards Troost, which had been seeing small scale fighting since the start of the operation. Then, on August 14th, Troost would be finally liberated, delivering a crushing blow to the Automatons from which they still have not recovered.\nTopography.\nIn terms of topography, Troost is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; in terms of both plant life and geography. Interestingly all three planets are even home to similar species of violet flowers that grow from strange, parasitic outcroppings; whether there is some sort of correlation is currently under investigation by Federation scientists. The Automatons likely choose Troost as their communications hub because of it's location on the edge of the galactic rim, as well as it's grey fog covered surface more easily concealing the automatons facilities from orbital observation. An assumption which cost them dearly..."}

{"id": "3263", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3263", "title": "Turing", "text": "Turing is one of the four planets that reside in the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Its general landscape consists of heavy forests and rocky plateaus, with occasional large lakes. The planet is also home to the Galaxy's leading Xenoentomology Center, where Super Earth's leading Terminid experts and FTL engineers from across the galaxy converge to begin development of High-Efficiency Alcubiere Drives.\nTopography.\nTuring is characterized by its vibrant, colorful plant life. Much of the planet's surface is covered in purplish grasses, which release large amounts of pollen into the air. Its trees are divided between taller purple varieties and shorter red varieties. Citizens are reminded that recreational photography is restricted on the Barrier Planets, as of Statue C-30817.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nDeployment of the Terminid Control System.\nTuring was briefly a frontline planet from the 14th of February to the 23rd. A Terminid outbreak occurred in the area on March 6th, causing fighting to resume until the 14th of March. Fighting ended with the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt; on the planet. Turing was not considered a strategically important world at this point, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;fascist Terminid pest&lt;/a&gt; on her surface to persist unchecked for far too long. \nFailure of the Terminid Control System.\nOn April 29th, Operation Legitimate Undertaking was interrupted by massive Terminid outbreaks in the Umlaut sector, including on Turing. A malfunction in the TCS allowed the bugs to reproduce at a much higher rate, turning the neighboring planet &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; into a Supercolony. The Helldivers were quickly deployed to deactivate the TCS throughout the Umlaut Sector. On May 3rd, the TCS on Turing was shut down, preventing it from meeting the same tragic fate as Meridia. However, its close proximity to the Supercolony left it at constant risk of assault.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOn May 21, 2184, after the declaration of the Second Galactic War, the Terminids launched another brutal assault against Turing. The Helldivers were dispatched here and heroically routed the enemy by day's end. On May 24th, another assault was launched. Unfortunately, with Helldivers' attention being split between &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt;, local defense forces were overrun by the tyrannical bugs, who quickly re-occupied the planet. The very next day, Operation Enduring Peace was announced to retake Turing and establish a foothold toward liberating Meridia. \nOperation Enduring Peace.\nTo properly deal with Meridia, the SEAF retook and defended Turing, along with Angel's Venture and &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt;. On June 1st, with progress on destroying &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; well underway, the Terminids launched an opportunistic strike on Turing. The Defense of Turing began on June 1st, with ~10,000 Helldivers being dispatched here, and another ~3,500 fighting on nearby &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Terminids' tyrannical methods allowed them to gain the upper hand, the USAF was able to control the planet for long enough to provide a temporary foothold toward Meridia. Operation Enduring Peace came to an end with the collapse of Meridia into a black hole using &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt; technology. \nOperation Destiny Manifested.\nWith the Meridia Supercolony being permanently destroyed, the SEAF was ordered to take back nearby contested planets: Turing, &lt;a href=\"Erata%20Prime\"&gt;Erata Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phact%20Bay\"&gt;Phact Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Turing was the first planet to be liberated in this successful operation, allowing Super Earth citizens to finally resettle the lands they had been forced to abandon. \nOperation Glorious Xenocide.\nTuring was briefly attacked on July 21st. The Helldivers held the line valiantly and turned the Terminid assault around, now forcing them back to Acamar IV and then, on July 23rd, back to Gacrux. \nOperation Alcubierre-II.\nFollowing the last assault onto Turing, it spent the rest of the summer of 2184 in relative peace, as the Terminids shifted focus towards the rest of the Jin Xi Sector. With the apparition of the Gloom, most threats to Turing's security were gone, as the planets within the Gloom that could have posed a threat seemingly stopped attacking its neighbors. However, the threat at Gacrux still remained. After Acamar IV fell on September 25th, Turing would immediately be attacked by the Terminids, just as Super Earth ordered the construction of a new Xenoentomology Center on the planet.\nAs such, the Helldivers were ordered to defend and hold Turing while construction was underway, as this new center would help make the Alcubierre Warp Drive of the Super Destroyers more efficient in its E-710 consumption. As such, the Helldivers deployed en masse once more onto the planet, holding the line from September 27th to September 29th, successfully driving back the insectoid menace.\nTuring would be successfully defended on September 26th. However, due to its newly found relevance in relation to the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, the Terminids would make huge efforts to invade the planet in order to impede the construction of the Xenoentomology Center. After they amassed their forces following their defeat at Achird III, the Terminids would launch a second final assault from Acamar IV once more on October 2nd. However, this time, the Helldivers would not only successfully rally at &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; and deliver a crippling blow to the fascist bugs, but they would also wind up liberating &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt;, cutting off a nearby source of terminid spores and setting up a defensive perimeter around the planet that, for the moment, safeguards the planet and its new xenoentomology center.\nMeanwhile the other side of the galaxy, the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; attempted to capitalize on our noble scientific efforts by assaulting &lt;a href=\"Mastia\"&gt;Mastia&lt;/a&gt; intending to cut off the &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;DSS Logistics Hub&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;DSS&lt;/a&gt; itself. But the Helldivers quickly organized a daring counterattack, saving Mastia and liberating &lt;a href=\"Shelt\"&gt;Shelt&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nThanks to these valiant efforts, ground has been broken on the new Xenoentomology Center on Turing. Super Earth's leading Terminid experts and FTL engineers from across the galaxy have converged on the planet to begin development of High-Efficiency Alcubiere Drives. These new drives will enable the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; to warp between planets at the Helldivers' direction, dispensing Freedom wherever it is needed. Research and development of this new technology will take weeks, during which time the center must remain safe from Terminid infestation, or our research progress will be lost. Thanks to the valiant efforts of the Helldivers, all of humanity will soon step forward into a more prosperous, energy efficient, and peaceful future.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nTuring would remain free of any Terminid presence after the construction of the Xenoentomology Center concluded. It would seem that, after all, things hadn't come to boil, even after the severe tactical miscalculation at &lt;a href=\"Gacrux\"&gt;Gacrux&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Crossroads. But the seeds of fascism had already been sown on the Terminid Research Preserve, and it was only a matter of time before their bore their nefarious fruits.\nOn November 12th, in the middle of a busy day for the Tyranny Park, a massive underground Terminid hive erupted spontaneously, leading to a bloody massacre of visitors and park staff alike. Acamar IV was overrun in mere minutes, which prevented the nuclear security measures from being activated and allowed the Terminids to take over the planet without any impediment. Once Acamar IV fell, it launched 5 simultaneous attacks onto all of the planets connected to it. This catastrophe could not have been any more poorly timed, as the Jet Brigade had also just returned in massive numbers and destroyed the DSS Logistics Hub on &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe painting was clear on the wall that the Helldivers had to act quick before more damage had to be done. Despite Acamar's positioning, High Command gave the indication to protect the Xenoentomology Center at Turing by all means, as it still contained critical research material on the Terminids, pretty much dooming Acamar IV and all of its attached planets to perdition.\nAfter 16 hours of fighting, Turing was saved, at the expense of losing not just Acamar but also all the other planets connected to it except for Turing. With the Jet Brigade approaching Mastia, the final nail in the coffin was put, with 3 months of sacrifices being lost as the Borgus Sector fell back to Terminid control, while the Jin Xi sector's liberation was pretty much undone."}

Although only a steppingstone on the way to the former Automaton production world of &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt;, Ubanea would forever leave a lasting mark on the Helldiver Corps following the disaster that was the Ubanea Gambit.\nTopography.\nUbanea's topography is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Crimsica\"&gt;Crimsica&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt consists of large, open stretches of rocky hills, which are intersected by mountain ranges. It is devoid of trees and large flora, instead being largely covered by a crimson red algae. The surface is covered in a mostly persistent greenish-gray fog of medium-thickness, which may reduce visibility somewhat. It often experiences bursts of short rain showers.\nUbanea's geography is very mountainous, with mostly rocky terrain. Large hilltops covered in sharp boulders are found en masse. Ubanea has oceans, though large cliffs often surround the shore, with occasional gravelly beaches.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nUbanea Gambit - 30 March 2184.\nDuring the second phase of Operation Swift disassembly, Draupnir, a key planet supplying the assault on Ubanea was hit by a surprise &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; assault. With the initial defense of the planet failing, the Helldivers were faced with a choice of either dedicating adequate troops to hold &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; from a direct Automaton assault or attempting to finish the liberation of Ubanea to serve as a new planetary base of operations whilst Draupnir was retaken. In the end, the Helldiver Corps opted for the latter choice.\nHowever, the initial hours of indecision resulted in insufficient concentration of troops to achieve either objective. Draupnir initially held a reserve force representing just under 20% of all active Helldivers, which created a solid foothold, but was insufficient to gain an advantage over the Automaton assault.\nAs the event continued, they came close to achieving their goal, however not enough Helldivers could be swayed from other fronts to gain the numbers needed to actually turn the tide. As the hours grew shorter, eventually, they abandoned Draupnir's defense in favor of attempting to burn down Ubanea. But by this point it was too little, too late, resulting in the worst possible outcome for our forces. As Draupnir fell, Ubanea stood at 95(.54)% liberated and would have required another few hours to be fully secure had the Helldivers supply lines to Draupnir not been cut. In the end, the Helldivers were forced to retreat back to Super Earth space in defeat.\nHad our forces decided earlier what to do, or alternatively, managed to sway more of the roughly 35% of Helldivers active on the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; front, then today would have been cause for celebration. But victories need to be earned in order to be meaningful, and victory has not been earned this day. The Helldivers task now is to retake Draupnir to enable FTL lines to Ubanea to be re-established, before the Automatons can shore up defenses and replace their losses. This setback would prove to be significant and may compromise Operation Swift Disassembly if Draupnir and Ubanea are not retaken quickly.\nAnother significant obstacle in our operations has been the ongoing support of expeditionary forces on &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. Long standing as a bastion of human endurance and a symbol of our resistance against the Automatons, Malevelon Creek remained locked in a stalemate with an average 25% of our forces committed to its defense and eventual liberation, though success on Draupnir, Ubanea, and eventually &lt;a href=\"Tibit\"&gt;Tibit&lt;/a&gt; seems unlikely with such a large contingent diverted elsewhere..."}

The TCS would be constructed on an unbroken line of barrier planets in the Umlaut Sector, with the plan being to quarantine the bugs behind them.\nAfter the bugs were pushed back to the barrier planets, where after weeks of work SEAF engineers had finished a building a network of massive, Termicide-dispensing towers upon each Barrier Planet: the key to the Terminid Control System. Once activated, the TCS would exterminate every Terminid on that planet, and inoculate it against all future infestations. However, surges in Terminid activity also forced the SEAF Engineers to evacuate, with the Helldivers being sent into activate the Terminid Control System at any cost.\nThe Terminid Control System would later be successfully and fully activated several days later thanks to the efforts of the Helldivers. The Termicide would work as intended, culling millions of Terminids on the Barrier Planets. Super Earth's citizens could finally rest easy, knowing their children were forever safe from being eaten alive by fascist insects...\nTCS Failure Incident.\nA month after activating the Terminid Control System, SEAF units stationed on the Barrier Planets reported a significant surge in Terminid reproduction rates. Notably, the offspring from this surge exhibited immunity to Termicide, a previously deemed impossible feat by Super Earth Scientists. The Terminids successfully infiltrated and infested the Termicide towers, converting them into massive colonies and hatcheries. The situation escalated to the extent that Meridia became overrun, rendering the planet unsalvagable.\nIn response, Helldivers were promptly instructed to halt the ongoing Operation, Legitimate Undertaking on the Automaton front and redirect their efforts to the Barrier Planets. Their mission: to deactivate the corrupted TCS on the remaining planets. They succeeded in this Noble goal on april 5th, successfully deactivating the TCS on Errata prime, Turing, and Fenrir III"}

As the defenses in Mantes and Draupnir fell and the Automatons encroached further and further into the Galactic Rim, they eventually advanced onto Ustotu.\nIt would be here where their advances would be stopped, as the Helldivers began to gain momentum and forced the Automatons to divert their resources towards Tien Kwan, a fruitless endeavor that ultimately paved the way for the robot's demise. Ustotu would be caught in the crossfire between the Helldivers and the Automatons, being stuck in a liberation campaign for months.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nAs the bots began losing ground and the Helldivers approached the Xzar and Severin Sectors, the Automatons withdrew. With the liberation of Troost, their offensive in Ustotu would be crippled, as they had lost the FTL Line that allowed them to stay supplied. Ustotu and Vandalon IV would be liberated shortly after.\nUstotu would remain under the stewardship of Super Earth for the remainder of the operation, with its colonists joyously celebrating the victory at Malevelon Creek and the righteous eradication of the Automatons at Malevelon Creek.\nBut peace was to be short-lived. A mere 3 days after their grandiose victory, the Automatons returned, taking over the Valdis Sector and rapidly advancing through the neighboring Andromeda Sector.\nThe Second Galactic War had begun\nSecond Galactic War.\nAs the bots were contained in the Menkent Line, they would withdraw into defensive positions, consolidating their defenses around the planets immediately adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, with neighboring Varylia 5 and Choepessa IV falling into the enemies' mechanical hands. However, as the war progressed and the Helldivers encircled them, the bots would begin making attempts to break out of the Valdis sector and expand their territories, by making daring raids throughout the Trigon Sector. In early May, they attempted to jump out of &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; and into the Xzar Sector through &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; but were successfully repelled, leading them to concentrate their advance on the planets connected to Choepessa IV. \nWhile seeing some initial success, with their advances into Varylia 5 and into the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt; being mostly successful, they would be quickly halted and their successes reversed after Operation Emancipator returned Varylia 5 to the Helldivers, which then forced the bots to attack the only other planet that was connected to Choepessa IV: Ustotu \nDefense of Ustotu (June 9th - June 10th).\nThe Automatons would return to Ustotu on evening of June 9th, 2184. Due to Major Orders from High Command enforicing the focus on &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the planet would end up falling by the next day, getting trapped in a deadlock.\nShortly after, as the Helldivers were ordered back into the Terminid Front and then focused on defending the Xzar Sector, the Automatons launched an assault onto Troost. Once Troost's defenses collapsed, both it and Ustotu would be lost for good, as the bots would shortly recover Varylia 5 after a successful assault from Choepessa IV overwhelmed its defenses.\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nUstotu remained under Automaton occupation throughout the month of June and into July. However, its chance at liberation would appear from an unlikely source. After securing the plans for the intergalactic battle station at X-45, the Automaton Front would be split in half after the success of Operation Righteous Expunge. With Ustotu now cut away from its supply lines to Cyberstan, the order was issued for the liberation of all planets within the encirclement zone. Once Choepessa was liberated on July 28th, some Helldivers would divert towards Ustotu to assist local resistance efforts in order to thwart possible counteroffensives. \nThen, on July 31st, shortly after victory at Varylia 5, the main force of the Helldivers began to arrive at Ustotu. The battle would be fierce and lengthy, which would buy the Automaton garrison at Wezen time to fortify its defenses. Victory would be achieved at the late hours of August 1st after almost a full day of fighting, which ultimately made Operation Liberty Crush fail."}

Whilst it might appear from orbit that much of the surface is covered in crimson red grass, this grass is in reality a crimson algae that has propagated wildly across the entire planet.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nReturn of the Illuminate.\nValmox was, for much of its recorded history, a peaceful planet colony of the Federation of Super Earth that, by all standards, was pretty uneventful. Having been settled at some during the Great Democratization after the First Galactic War, the first colonists possibly found a naturally resource-rich and fertile region in which to settle. This resulted in the colonists congregating into more in fortified communities over time, which ultimately developed into the planet's first true cities, complete with working appliances, services such as electricity and waste management and many other staples of urban living.\nHowever, an old foe of Managed Democracy dedicated themselves to staring at Valmox with envy from deep within the endless vastness of space. The , once thought defeated and extinct, had returned and were once again determined to wage war against Freedom.\nOn December 17th, Valmox was attacked in tandem with &lt;a href=\"Kerth%20Secundus\"&gt;Kerth Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, another planet colony in another sector. However, Valmox's hopes were not lost as the Helldivers, who had already defeated the Illuminate before at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bellatrix\"&gt;Bellatrix&lt;/a&gt;, were determined to end this odious stalking of Valmox's noble citizenry once and for all. For almost 8 hours, the Helldivers valiantly held the line at Valmox while the invaders at Kerth were repelled. Then, once Kerth Secundus had been rescued, the Helldiver Corps concentrated on Valmox and cast the alien invaders away, safeguarding its citizens and settlements once again."}

Purposeful terraforming efforts by the federation as well as the industry of Automaton factories have warmed the planet enough that the ice has started to melt, creating several large oceans, though the water is still too cold to safely swim in. Colonists still need to wear extra layers of clothing when going outside, whilst intense snow storms are an almost daily occurrence.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOperation Swift Disassembly.\nPhase One.\nDuring first phase of operation Swift Disassembly, &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt;, which was lying deeper within Trigon Sector was deemed an important Long-Range Communication Array. With Vandalon laying on the FTL path to it, it was quickly liberated shortly after &lt;a href=\"Ustotu\"&gt;Ustotu&lt;/a&gt; on March 28th, 2184.\nPhase Four.\nDuring the late Operation Swift Disassembly, the Automatons probably discovered a new Route directly to Vandalon IV resulting in a swift attack while many &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; were focusing on holding the ground of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ubanea\"&gt;Ubanea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; as well as attacking the remaining Automaton planets. While most Helldivers underestimated the importance of Vandalon IV as a planet that was now a barrier between the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Sector\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;, a few Helldivers engaged in a swift and bloody fight on the Planet.\nWhile the fight looked like a loss, many Helldivers fought brave against the Automatons without receiving much reinforcements from the other frontlines. While many Helldivers weren't able to see how important Vandalon IV was, the remaining troops and inhabitants on Vandalon IV, stood strong together. In a bloody fight they were able to defend the planet successfully in a very narrow victory and thus secured the last phase of the Operation Swift Disassembly. This planet suffered the last attack by the Automatons prior to their attack on the Northwestern region of the galaxy.\nBy April 9th, Vandalon IV and the surrounding systems were safe, sound and in the tender care of Managed Democracy.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Xzar Lockdown.\nDuring operation Xzar Lockdown, Automaton invasion fleet has made planetfall on Vandalon, while most of helldivers were busy securing &lt;a href=\"Mort\"&gt;Mort&lt;/a&gt; in Xzar Sector. Control over planet was declared lost shortly after midnight of June 23rd, after which the Automatons launched a surprise assault onto &lt;a href=\"Mantes\"&gt;Mantes&lt;/a&gt; through a newly opened FTL supply line. \nThen, immediately after Mantes' defense had succeeded, they launched a second assault onto Ingmar on the late hours of June 23rd, with said assault also being repealed by the morning of June 24th.\nSuper Earth Tactical Command deems Vandalon IV a second-tier priority target, as its position allows the Automatons to easily throw concurrent assaults at the Xzar Sector and, given the newly discovered capabilities of the enemy, puts them right at the doorsteps of &lt;a href=\"Malevelon%20Creek\"&gt;Malevelon Creek&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly advised that, unless ordered elsewhere, Helldivers prioritize its liberation.\nOn July 17th, with the success of Operation Andromeda, this planet, alongside all planets in the Ymir, Trigon and Andromeda Sectors, has seen its defenses collapse, meaning that no liberation progress will be undone.. or so we thought.\nHowever, on July 23rd, a strategic update was rolled out, announcing that the automatons have rapidly began repairing their communications and forces, therefore increasing their defenses and resistance again. This caused the liberation rate to begin declining again as the decay rate became enough to overpower the little forces fighting on the planet. With the liberation of Ustotu incoming as of August 1st, there won't be many planets left in the cut-off forces anymore. Let us hope that this brings the final liberation of this illegally held world upon us soon..\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nAfter their victory at &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers would manage to secure a defensive line of planets that split the bot front in half, with Vandalon IV being within the encircled domain. As such, Super Earth High Command issued an order for the immediate recapture of five of the encircled planets. Although Vandalon IV was not one of the key targets of the operation and the major order was an overall failure due to the &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; being captured behind schedule.\nHowever the successful capture of Wezen and defence of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt; following the operation, meant that both the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; Sectors are once again securely in Super Earths hands. High Command's strategy of dividing the bot forces is now a firm reality, with only &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; still in automaton clutches in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst the Automaton's may have won the battle, the Super Earth Armed Forces are well on their way to winning the war.\nOperation Lighthouse.\nVandalon IV would be completely cut off from Cyberstan after Operation Liberty Crush. As such, it and Troost represented the only remaining vestiges of Automaton power in the old territories that they once occupied. As such, the Helldivers were order to finally squash this last pocket of Automaton resistance once and for all. Vandalon IV would be liberated by the Helldivers on August 12th, after 2 days or arduous fighting over the frozen planet, Troost would follow, being liberated on August 14th, marking the complete destruction of the Automaton Encirclement."}

The planet was unremarkable until it was discovered that the Automaton's were building a massive factory on the planet, which the Super Earth Armed Forces were able to capture and modify into a second Morgunson Arsenal; used to build the new &lt;a href=\"EXO-49%20Emancipator%20Exosuit\"&gt;EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nVarylia 5 is a planet covered in barren grassy plains and rocky hills, blanketed by perpetual fog and prone to torrential rainstorms. Due to it's distance from Super Earth and it's previously hostile nature, Varylia 5 was sparsely populated and even more sparsely defended even before the outbreak of the Second Galactic War. As a result, it was captured by the Automatons early, only being liberated in the first phase of operation swift disassembly.\nHowever this has not been the first time that the planet has felt the bootstrap of socialist tyranny as one hundred years ago, the planet was one of the many occupied by the . Back then, Varylia was a very hostile world, plagued by a scorching environment, plagued by geological instability which caused mantle to bubble up from the planets core to create seas of magma that cover most of the surface. Even so, the parts of the planet that weren't covered in lava were incredibly fertile, with some supporting small islands of vibrant green plant life in the form of shrubs and grasses. Some Helldivers even reported burned trees and the bleached skeletons of animals, perhaps suggesting that Varylia 5 was not always so inhospitable.\nNever the less, following the end of the first war, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Expansion\"&gt;Ministry of Expansion&lt;/a&gt; gained oversight over the planet and began terraforming efforts. After a century of terraforming efforts, the planet has become a lot more hospitable and geologically stable, with environmental conditions now similar to &lt;a href=\"Draupnir\"&gt;Draupnir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The redirection of ice comets to cool the oceans of lava has created not only large contents of rocky basalt, but also created huge bodies of water which allowed for more plant life (and regular humans) to thrive (had the first colonies not been blown up by &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;rampaging socialist toasters&lt;/a&gt; who then built their \"Petafactory\" on the ruins, polluting the planets once pristine atmosphere).\nNever the less, the planet still stands as a testimony to humanity's ability to tame even the harshest of planets, and will be reclaimed in the name of freedom soon...\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nAutomaton Invasion of Cyberstan.\nVarylia would be one of the first planets to fall to the red tide that arrived during the initial invasion of Cyberstan. It would be defended successfully on April 25th, 2184, but would then fall to a second assault on May 20th.\nSecond Galactic War.\nAs the war developed, Varylia would remain relatively safe, untouched by the mechanical scourge even when left unattended amidst the Disaster of Meridia, which shook up things in the Automaton Front and forced vast amounts of troops and material away from it.\nIt wouldn't be until after the declaration of the Second Galactic War that Varylia, having been left underdefended, would tragically fall to the cybernetic menace. This time, the robots would show their true plans for the planet, as they would bring their previously interrupted plans into fruition. Super Earth Intelligence scan revealed that a megafactory, called the \"Petrafactory\" by enemy transmissions was at the advanced stages of its construction, with goals for it still unknown. Analysts noted a particular resemblance to the Morguson Armories in Tien Kwan, which could indicate that the robots, sapping the cunning and hard work of the citizens of Super Earth as usual, had decided to undertake the endeavor of creating superweapons of unknown nature.\nOperation Emancipator.\nWith time running out, Super Earth High Command, shortly after the failure of Operation Freedom's Calling, would issue a major order for the immediate liberation of Varylia 5 and its \"Petafactories\", in order to repurpose them for the mass production of EXO-49 Dual-Autocannon Emancipator Exosuits. No sooner had the first SEAF standard issue boots set foot on Varylia 5's soil then did fresh intel warn of an increased level of Automaton resistance, likely a last-ditch effort to forestall their inevitable defeat.\nNever the less after a day of some of the heaviest Automaton resistance in the war so far (5%), the Helldivers had managed to make a foothold on the planet for the Super Earth Armed Forces, though were unable to push forward much further. However it was then that the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Intelligence\"&gt;Ministry of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; reported that spore activity on the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridian Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; had abruptly increased within the last 24 hours, with sudden Terminid outbreaks occurring on previously-safe planets as a result (yet more evidence of a Bug-Bot conspiracy). One such planet was &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture,&lt;/a&gt; which if overrun would result in the loss of the valuable, newly-constructed SEAF Training Facility on the planet, which will significantly decrease the capability of the Super Earth Armed Forces to aid in galactic defense.\nThus Super Earth High Command recommended the prioritization of the defense of Angel's Venture over the offensive on Varylia 5, with the Helldivers being redirected to the planet. After Angel's Venture was saved, the Helldivers returned to Varylia 5 where the Automaton resistance had been worn down significantly (from 5% to 3.5%). On May 26th, 2184, the planet was liberated from the toasters' grasp. When the first Super-Earth engineers arrived at the Petrafactory, it was discovered with great horror that the working conditions were abhorrent (even by Bot standards), with millions of cramped Automaton drones working endlessly in an unsafe factory environent to produce weapons for the Socialist war machine. Well-compensated Super-Earth engineers, as of this writing, are hard at work retrofitting the Petrafactory to produce Emancipator Exosuits.\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nVarylia 5 would not remain under Super Earth's embrace for long. shortly after Operation Emancipator concluded, Operation Enduring Peace commenced on the Eastern Front in order to put an end to the Meridian Supercolony Crisis, which had spread beyond all tolerable thresholds. As the war progressed into June, Varylia's defenses would remain pulled away from their garrison and into other operations, which allowed the Automatons to launch an assault on the planet and retake it in the early weeks of July prior to Operation Xzar Lockdown.\nHowever, not all would be lost for Varylia. Shortly after their victory at X-45 during Operation Starslayer and Operation Andromeda, the Automaton Front would be severed in half, with the occupying bot garrison in Varylia being cut off from their supply line to Cyberstan. Immediately, the order was given to recapture all of the planets within the encirclement zone, which opened the way for Varylia's liberation. As Operation Righteous Expunge forced the tin man's fist out of its forward bases at &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt; and Choepessa, scattered fighting began to take place in Varylia, as Helldivers returned to support what little resistance fighters they could. However, the real battle for Varylia 5 would begin on July 29th, once Vega Bay had been retaken from the Automatons.\nThe battle would be fierce and lengthy, requiring the entirety of the day of July 30th. Progress was slow, and the newly installed &lt;a href=\"Automaton%20Orbital%20Cannons\"&gt;Automaton Orbital Cannons&lt;/a&gt; made it more difficult to support the ground efforts. But nevertheless, the Helldivers came out victorious over the socialist machines, successfully expelling them off Varylia on the afternoon of July 31st."}

However, peace was not to last. On June 2nd, 2184, shortly after the conclusion of Operation Enduring Peace, Automaton Forces in &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault at Vega Bay, in pursuit of their goal of kicking the SEAF out of the Ymir Sector and ultimately enlarge their entrenchment into the Western Galactic Rim. By June 3rd, Vega Bay had fallen to the Automaton assaults and the liberation campaign failed due to FTL lines to &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; being cut off.\nOperation Valiant Resistance.\nSecond Battle of Vega Bay (June 8th-9th).\nAfter the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, Helldivers flooded to Vega Bay, as it was next in the route to Wasat, the location of the rumored Database one, an important Automaton Datacenter. Progress was swift, with the indomitable might of the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; crushing the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; stationed here. At 10pm Earth Super Time the last &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; on this planet were scrapped, &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; were quick to move to the Automaton world of &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, The home of Database One.\nOperation Starslayer.\nThird Battle of Vega Bay (July 5th-8th ).\nOperation Starslayer began on July 3rd. Automaton forces scrambled to make counterattacks aimed at cutting off reinforcements to the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa system&lt;/a&gt;. Vega bay, being part of the supply line connecting the Ymir Sector to the rest of Super Earth's space, became a target of interest for the socialist machines. \nA defense campaign began on July 5th to hold the system. Due to it's strategic importance, Vega Bay received more reinforcement than the neighbouring systems, which ultimately decided the fate of this defensive campaign. However, a second assault followed on July 6th, which would not enjoy as much aid. This inevitably led to Vega Bay falling on July 7th.\nOperation Liberty Crush.\nFourth Battle of Vega Bay.\nFor 3 weeks, Vega Bay remained in a bloody stalemate between the Helldivers and the Automatons, as the Helldivers had to jump back to the Terminid Front then towards the Hydra and Lacaille Sectors. However, with Operation Andromeda, the Automaton front was severed in half, leaving Vega Bay disconnected from Cyberstan, with its defenses in disarray. Before it could recover, the Helldivers would send the main fleet towards it, seeking to open the line towards Wezen. By July 30th, Vega Bay had been finally liberated once and for all, with the Automatons being squeezed out of the Ymir Sector on August 4th with the liberation of Wezen, ensuring Vega Bay would remain free for good."}

Citizens are reminded to be wary of local flora and fauna, which may possess dangerous and/or undemocratic qualities.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOperation Veld Containment.\nVeld was one of the first planets to see action during the Special Military Operations that took place on the Terminid Front prior to the Second Galactic War. Shortly after the Automaton Expedition began, a &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; outbreak occured on Veld not long after &lt;a href=\"Heeth\"&gt;Heeth&lt;/a&gt; and neighboring &lt;a href=\"Angel%27s%20Venture\"&gt;Angel's Venture&lt;/a&gt; had been liberated. The liberation of Veld occurred without incident during the weeks of March 2184. \nFollowing its liberation, Veld would remain at peace, in part due to the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt; on all four planets of the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Though the TCS spared Veld most of the horrors of war endured by other planets, the TCS eventually failed, culminating with the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; into a Terminid Supercolony. \nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Enduring Peace.\nPeace would not last much longer on Veld. As Supercolony spore outbreaks spread in the vicinity of Meridia, the Helldivers struggled to contain the fascistic outbursts while also taking on the mechanical menace that loomed on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;. On May 28th, Veld saw its first Terminid outbreak in two months, alongside with nearby &lt;a href=\"Cirrus\"&gt;Cirrus&lt;/a&gt;, an unconnected planet in the Orion System.\nVeld thankfully withstood the assault, with the outbreak being heroically contained by the early hours of May 29th. It is not known why the Terminids would attempt an assault on this planet, with the leading hypothesis being a coordinated attempt by the fascistic insectoids to spread toward Moradesh and hamper the deployment of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fluid\"&gt;Dark Fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Their efforts were in vain, as the weapon was later used to destroy the Meridia Supercolony once and for all."}

The name of the planet is no doubt a reference to the actor &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Wells_%28actor%29\"&gt;Vernon Wells&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally the difference in spelling might be another nod to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne\"&gt;Jules Verne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent Line&lt;/a&gt;, the planet would play host to a SEAF Forward Command Base, which would provide fresh recruits and supplies to the frontlines on &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;. However this forward command base was severely destroyed following the &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; breach and the fall of the planet, although this was thankfully temporary. \nDue to it's already existing facilities, the planet would be one of the four chosen by Super Earth High Command to be the location of new training facilities, required to process the Billions of able-bodied citizens from across the Federation who volunteered for conscription following the official declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny. Sadly these facilities were destroyed several days later, during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Freedom%27s%20Calling\"&gt;Operation Freedom's Calling&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, these facilities would pave the way for Vernen Wells' most salient chapter of the war, as the ruins of the Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children would shelter refugees from the Automatons until the Helldivers heroically rescued all 4,311 children from their malicious siege, choosing to save lives over weapons.\nVernen Wells would fall once more but would be ultimately liberated months later, during Operation Ecological Immolation, before falling yet again to the Automatons during Operation Bulwark of Democracy.\nTopography.\nNicknamed \"The Red Planet\", Vernen Wells is an arid, rocky planet featuring great shallow basins, sunken deserts, picturesque buttes and mesas, and rare verdant sections of valley. By and large though the planet is dominated by a series of continent mesas and plateaus, some of which are the size of skyscrapers. This has created an unexpected challenge for Helldivers operating on the planet, as this geography has been reported to obstruct some stratagems.\nIron minerals, and particularly hematite, are responsible for coloring the planet's sedimentary rock layers, which when combined with the planet's seismic instability has created large quantities of dust due to soil surface disturbance. This combined with strong winds has resulting in a fine layer of red dust that covers most of the planet (thus it's charming nickname) which has also been known to clog up both unprotected machinery as well as lungs.\nThe majority of plant life on the planet consists of dry grasslands and shrub lands, with the arid nature of Vernen Wells also driving the evolution of exceptionally efficient water usage in its various organisms.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations prior to the Second Galactic War.\nOperation Enduring Bulwark.\nIn an act of sinister syncronicity, both the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; launched large-scale assaults on the Federation at the same time. The Helldivers were forced to defend citizens on two fronts at once, stretching their numbers and resources thin, with &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt; being the breaking point. Following the breach of the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent line&lt;/a&gt; at Lesath, Vernen Wells itself would come under heavy assault by Automaton forces on the 21st of April. Whilst the Helldivers would contest their invasion of the planet, they lacked the numbers needed to a decisive win and could only slow down the invasion.\nDuring the invasion, the Automaton horde were able to knock out the planet's long-range communication arrays which had been used to track our forces across the galaxy. This meant that, unfortunately, High Command were unable to provide updates to liberation percentage and ongoing galactic war progress for the foreseeable future. Super Earth High Command then dispatched expert S.E.A.F. engineering teams, under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt;, to repair these arrays as soon as possible. In the meantime, some errors and incomplete data would be displayed on &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; systems and tracking software.\nCommunications would be nominally restored in the early hours of the 22nd of April, although by this point significant ground had been lost both on Vernen Wells and across the Galaxy. By the next day, Vernen Wells had been lost despite a valiant defense, and the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; were still refusing to let up as they pushed even deeper into Super Earth territory. Never the less, S.E.A.F. and the Helldivers would remain resolute, with the war for the survival of humanity and the Federation continuing.\n[ALERT: ENCRYPTED TRANSMISSION RECEIVED: DECRYPTING...]\nCLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET\nMINISTRY OF DEFENSE\nDIRECTORATE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE\nORIGINATING STATION: Super Earth Armed Forces Forward Command Base, Vernen Wells\nMEMORANDUM FOR: Super Earth High Command\nSUBJECT: Analysis of Lesath Breach and Defense West\nAUTHENTICATION BY THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH\nAUTHENTICATION CONFIRMED: Accessing file\nAnalysis of Lesath Breach and Defense West\nOngoing analysis by the Directorate of Military Intelligence has confirmed that the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;eastern front&lt;/a&gt; is stabilizing, whilst the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;western front&lt;/a&gt; is nearing total collapse. This document seeks to understand why this is the case, beyond higher concentrations of Helldivers.\nDiscounting the disproportionate deployment of the Helldiver Corps (40 - 60% as of this analysis) as well as difficulties in coordinating such a chaotic defense, success in the galactic west vs the galactic east is largely thanks to the success of the &lt;a href=\"Terminid%20Control%20System\"&gt;Terminid Control System&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt; are unable to advance further into federation space, which has allowed the majority of fighting in the east to be contained to &lt;a href=\"Estanu\"&gt;Estanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oshaune\"&gt;Oshaune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; (as well as provide a steady supply of much needed E-710).\nOn paper the &lt;a href=\"Menkent%20Line\"&gt;Menkent line&lt;/a&gt; should have served a similar purpose as the TCS, containing the fighting to &lt;a href=\"Matar%20Bay\"&gt;Matar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martale\"&gt;Martale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt;. However the Lesath breach two days into the Automaton's fresh offensive put an end to any plans of using it as a bulwark to contain the Automatons. Additionally the failure of the Martale Gambit has allowed the Automaton's to spread their forces over a much wider front than anticipated, which in turn has forced S.E.A.F. and the Helldivers to do the same. This has resulted in fighting spreading out over almost a dozen planets in five different sectors, including (as of the time of writing): &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Choepessa%20IV\"&gt;Choepessa IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charbal-VII\"&gt;Charbal-VII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charon%20Prime\"&gt;Charon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nThis has only exasperated the already existing coordination and supply issues present within the Super Earth Armed Forces, with the Helldiver Corps spread too thin over too many fronts to put up any organized defense. Coincidentally the strategy employed by Automaton forces may be accidentally (or more worryingly, purposefully) bares some resemblance to Deep Operation Theory. This is a military theory developed by the Communist Soviet Union for its armed forces during the first half of the 20th century and emphasized destroying, suppressing or disorganizing enemy forces not only at the line of contact but also throughout the depth of the battlefield. (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_operation\"&gt;see attached historical document for more information&lt;/a&gt;)\nUnfortunately the best way to counter at this time is to dig in and weather the storm. Deep Operation Theory will only works with superior numbers and although the situation on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;western front&lt;/a&gt; is still unfolding, the Automaton's are having to spread themselves over a larger and larger front by the day. Combine that with the millions of losses the Automatons are suffering and the offensive should (Liberty willing) run out of steam eventually. Even so, drastic measures may need to be taken in order to preserve the remaining military strength of the Federation and prevent the total collapse of S.E.A.F. West.\nRecommendations for adaptations to strategy and tactics to follow within seven standard solar days.\nEND TRANSMISSION\nFollowing the Lesath breach and the diversion of manpower to the Terminid front due to the failure of the Terminid Control System, the Automaton Front collapsed, and Vernen Wells would endure a long siege against the mechanized war machine of the socialist Automatons.\nSecond Galactic War.\nThe loss of &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt; during Operation Legitimate Undertaking saw the loss of all working &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-tank Mines&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the tragic loss of many Super Earth Citizen Lives. As such, production had to be started in an alternate, undisclosed location. Unfortunately, said production could not commence due to a shortage of necessary metals. As a result, Super Earth High Command has issued the order to dismantle 2 billion automatons, in order to harvest their wretched metallic carcasses to melt them and repurpose them into tools for the unrestrained spread of freedom and democracy of the highest caliber physically possible.\nDespite falling short during this operation (as only 78% of the necessary scrap was collected), the Helldivers still managed to successfully defeat the Automaton siege of Vernen Wells and secure the planet. Moreover, following the official declaration of the Galactic War on Tyranny, the planet would be one of the lightly-populated planets where Super Earth High Command would choose to construct new training facilities in order to process the tens of millions of volunteer-conscripts who would soon reinforce the frontlines.\nOperation Freedom's Calling.\nThese facilities would be short-lived, as soon after the facilities were constructed, it would receive another assault, but now would count with less manpower than before, as most of it was diverted towards several different planets due to Operation Freedom's Calling, which called for the eradication of 3 billion enemies, regardless of whether it was bug, bot or dissident. The defenses were fierce, but would tragically fall to the unattended Automaton onslaught.\nThe loss of these facilities would permanently reduce the Helldiver's effectiveness in their liberation campaigns by an estimate of 5%, due to personnel shortages in the rest of the Super Earth Armed Forces.\nOperation Trolley Problem.\nFollowing the success of Operation Valiant Resistance and the capture of Database One, High Command has received two urgent requests for aid on planets that recently fell to the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; occupation: An emergency distress call from &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt; describes thousands of civilian survivors trapped in the remains of Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children. Food and water supplies are dwindling. Their survival even this long, after the fall of the SEAF Recruitment Facility on &lt;a href=\"Vernen%20Wells\"&gt;Vernen Wells&lt;/a&gt;, is remarkable. Without imminent rescue, they will soon perish of starvation, thirst, or &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; butchery.\nHowever, intercepted &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; communications have also identified a large explosives repository on &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;. Intel assesses with high confidence that these explosives came from &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt;, stolen during the initial &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; Invasion. These stores are very likely to contain the critical raw ingredients necessary to finally deploy &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines&lt;/a&gt;. Time is not on our side. Only the first planet liberated is likely to be saved. The Helldivers were trusted to determine which course of action\u2014rescuing the children, or the &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;AT Mines&lt;/a&gt;\u2014will ultimately save the most Freedom.\nUltimately, the vast majority of Helldivers would choose to liberate Vernen Wells and the children first. Following the liberation of the planet, SEAF forces would secure the Children's Hospital, and make contact with the civilians trapped underneath the rubble. The majority of the thousands of trapped civilians \u2014 including all 4,311 very sick children \u2014 were miraculously still alive. Rescue operations went underway immediately, however long-range imagery also showed heavy &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; transport activity on &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not exactly a strategically sound move in the short term as the &lt;a href=\"MD-17%20Anti-Tank%20Mines\"&gt;Anti-Tank Mine&lt;/a&gt; material has likely been moved far out of reach, it is the morally correct decision. In any case, the federation can take solace in the fact that the future of humanity is secure as the very sick children are en route to Super Citizen Mary's Hospital for Tragically Ill Youths, where they will receive the best care the Federation has to offer.\nTheir daring rescue has captured the spirits of all of Super Earth's citizens. A crowdsourced fund will pay for the remainder of their care and their military academy training and the children, in an inspiring act of patriotic gratitude, have all signed MOD Form 11 \"Intent to Enlist.\"\nOnce grown, they will join the ranks of SEAF and carry the torch of heroic valor that saved their lives. One day, perhaps, some of the children may even become &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nOperation Andromeda.\nVernen Wells would not remain free for long. Shortly after Operation Trolley Problem, the Helldivers would be order back towards the Terminid front, then to the Xzar Sector. Vernen Wells remained free during the whole month of June before falling to an automaton assault in July 8th, in the midst of Operation Starslayer, as the Automatons attempted to divert the Helldivers away from X-45 to try and prevent them from recovering the blueprints for the intergalactic battle station.\nHowever, this would not be the end of things as, shortly after, Super Earth High Command issued a major order with the objective of severing the Automaton front in half right through the Andromeda Sector, with Aesir Pass as its starting point. After Aesir Pass was liberated on July 13th, a liberation force was immediately sent to Vernen Wells, however, it wouldn't accomplish much, as the Automatons would push back into Aesir Pass and cut Vernen Wells off once more.\nOperation Ecological Immolation.\nVernen Wells remained under Automaton occupation ever since, as the Helldivers would be occupied with the eradication of the &lt;a href=\"Encirclements%23Matar_Bay_Encirclement\"&gt;Matar Bay Encirclement&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the Automatons in Vernen Wells would make no attempts, seemingly amassing their forces for a new, more sinister offensive that the red menace had been planning.\nOn August 11th, the Automaton vanguard on Aesir Pass successfully managed to invade &lt;a href=\"Curia\"&gt;Curia&lt;/a&gt;, immediately prompting Super Earth High Command to order the Helldivers back to the Marspira Sector in order to aide its defense and push back the robotic offensive. The Helldivers fought back ferociously and managed to repel the offensive, however, they wouldn't be able to repel a last minute surprise attack from Vernen Wells into Tarsh, which would allow the robots to have one last holding. This development would, however, turn out to work against them, as now the Helldivers had a new order.\nIn order to allow for the production of Orbital Napalm Barrages to continue, the Helldivers needed to collect 500 million Automatons worth of scrap metal and a major supply of polystyrene. And as Liberty would have it, Vernen Wells had both in spades. As such the order was given for the Helldivers to liberate Vernen Wells and kill 500 million Automatons. Vernen wells itself would officially be liberated on the 1st of September, with the polystyrene repository firmly secured. SEAF remedial personnel would move in to take over remaining site operations whilst the Helldivers redeployed to other fronts. Collateral damage was thankfully minimal, with the transport of stored assets to begin once the polystyrene was found amongst the resulting flood of packing peanuts.\nOperation Bulwark of Democracy.\nVernen Wells would remain free for the month of September, without much happening to it that was worthy of note, even as it posed a dangerous flank to &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; and, subsequently, to the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;Democracy Space Station&lt;/a&gt; once it began construction. The bots seemed to also be waiting for the right moment to strike at the red planet once more and, on October 8th, they found it. While the Helldivers were busy defending the newly acquired &lt;a href=\"Claorell\"&gt;Claorell&lt;/a&gt; from a massive attack coming from &lt;a href=\"Vog-Sojoth\"&gt;Vog-Sojoth&lt;/a&gt;, the automaton forces in Menkent immediately launched a secondary assault onto Vernen Wells. Due to the unavailability of the Helldivers during the early hours of the attack, the Automatons managed to secure much of the planet during the early hours. Once the attack at Claorell was repelled, all Helldivers available immediately re-routed for Vernen Wells, but still proved unable to repel the already too advanced robotic attack.\nVernen Wells fell on October 9th, however, the robots there would get caught on a stalemate. The devious machines sent a binary SOS to their evil central computers and, hours later, the Automaton forward base at &lt;a href=\"Clasa\"&gt;Clasa&lt;/a&gt; sent an attack towards &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt; to try and detach as many Helldivers as possible from the Red Planet so that the automaton forces trapped there could undo enough liberation to launch another offensive.\nOperation Spark of Liberty.\nFollowing its fall, Vernen Wells would be essentially left abandoned, as the Helldivers would be constantly pulled away from the Hydra Sector and towards other, more critical fronts. Despite this, Helldiver Tactical Command kept Vernen Wells as a high priority liberation target.\nThe suspicion was that, eventually, the Automatons would utilize Vernen Wells' highly strategic location to launch an assault on the Democracy Space Station when Super Earth least expected in. On November 11th, those suspicions came true, as SEAF Surveillance Satellites began to detect high concentrations of Automaton troops and material and, worst of all, Jet Brigade troops all across the surface of the planet. Super Earth was now in a race against time, as the Democracy Space Station was pretty much completed, with the fueling process requiring the Helldivers to kill 500,000,000 Terminids to procure the E-710 necessary to set the Democracy Space Station into motion. The Helldivers would somehow have to split between containing the most vicious invasion fleet of the bots while simultaneously killing enough Terminids to activate the Space Station.\nLater on November 11th, the Automatons at Vernen Wells would send the single biggest onslaught seen in the entire galactic war to that point, dispatching 58 battalions toward the DSS Logistics Hub at &lt;a href=\"Tarsh\"&gt;Tarsh&lt;/a&gt;. While the Helldivers would fight valiantly and fiercely to slow the Automaton advance, the Jet Brigade was far too numerous, easily overwhelming the SEAF and taking control of the planet by the next day, with &lt;a href=\"Gaellivare\"&gt;Gaellivare&lt;/a&gt; in the bots' cold, wicked red sights.\nInterim (Nov 12.--).\nLuckily, while Gaellivare would eventually fall to the Automaton Jet Brigade, the Helldivers had procured enough fuel to move the DSS off the planet just hours before the bots would punch through the SEAF's defense. While the Operation would be regarded as a technical success for ensuring the safety of the DSS, it would also be viewed as a SEAF failure, with huge swaths of territory now under Automaton control and the disastrous breach of the Terminid Research Preserve at &lt;a href=\"Acamar%20IV\"&gt;Acamar IV&lt;/a&gt; causing 4 planets to fall to the tyrannical .\nIn the time since the Operation, Vernen Wells would see very little action with the Helldivers having to contain the Terminid plague while simultaneously continuing their hunt for the vile Jet Brigade production site. Then, on December 12th, all Helldiver attention would be focused on the galactic south after the unthinkable, unfathomable, unreasonable return of the wretched and wicked --who were thought to be eradicated-- at &lt;a href=\"Calypso\"&gt;Calypso&lt;/a&gt;. This shocking return would cause the activation of LIBCON 1 and divert absolutely all resources to the unfolding situation, leaving the Automaton and Terminid fronts relatively undermanned. Since then, the Illuminate would conduct more and more raids throughout the underdefended galactic south, forcing the Helldivers to try to repel each and every threat.\nUnfortunately, this shocking and unforeseen development would grant the most valuable of resources to the enemies of Super Earth: time. The Automatons, recognizing the overall lack of SEAF forces on the Western Front, used this window of time to destructive effect. On December 26th, the Automatons at &lt;a href=\"Chort%20Bay\"&gt;Chort Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Penta\"&gt;Penta&lt;/a&gt; would send a combined 12 battalions toward the icey neighbor of Vernen Wells, &lt;a href=\"Lesath\"&gt;Lesath&lt;/a&gt;. As the Helldivers were forced to contain the squid threat at &lt;a href=\"Julheim\"&gt;Julheim&lt;/a&gt;, few would come to the defense of the strategic planet. Lesath would fall by the next day- and in the process, Vernen Wells would be cut off from any Super Earth supply lines, as Lesath was the only planet connected to the red planet that was under SEAF control. Thus, the red planet has been left to rot under the violent and brutal mechanical fist of the Automaton Legion, its justice awaiting a day that will surely bring it back under Liberty's grace."}

However; the Automatons, programmed to destroy what the hardworking colonists had worked so hard to settle, would not permit Vog-Sojoth to go untouched.\nAfter the Automatons invaded Cyberstan and occupied the Valdis Sector, they began to rapidly and aggressively occupy the planets immediately adjacent to the Valdis Sector. As the Helldivers raced to prevent the Automatons from advancing, neighbouring Lesath would fall into the mechanical grip of the killer robots, prompting Vog-Sojoth's Colonial Overseer to cut its FTL Lines with Lesath in order to safeguard the Tanis Sector from the socialist menace.\nAs the months passed, the colonists in Vog-Sojoth did what they could to reinforce their colony, stockpiling what little weapons they had while hoping that, when the FTL network was eventually restored, they would be greeted by the SEAF telling them they were safe. However, it was not in Liberty's plans for such a fate to befall on Vog-Sojoth.\nOn September 8th, 2184, the Automatons launched an assault from their Forward Command Post at Lesath and onto Vog-Sojoth, while also sending a massive attack from Gaellivare to Imber. The Helldivers, who had the mission of protecting Imber's titanium deposits by all means necessary, would see themselves forced to abandon Vog-Sojoth to its own meager devices.\nVog-Sojoth's Colonial Defenders fought hard, and the Helldivers that were able to do so provided significant support. However, by the time Imber was defended, Vog-Sojoth's defenses had already cracked, allowing the robots to take over the planet.\nFrom there, the bots would go on to launch a final assault from Vog-Sojoth to Claorell on September 11th, in tandem with a final attack from Gaellivare to Imber, with both attacks being successfully repelled, blocking the Automatons from obtaining Imber's titanium deposits.\nOperation Liberty Tide.\nHowever, the Automaton Vanguard at Vog-Sojoth had a particularly relentless programming. With an unquenchable expansionist thirst, the Automatons then turned towards the opposite side and sent an attack from Vog-Sojoth towards Clasa and Claorell. Due to logistical issues concerning the unusually difficult liberation campaign at &lt;a href=\"Pandion-XXIV\"&gt;Pandion-XXIV&lt;/a&gt;, the Helldivers were unable to divert enough manpower towards both of the planets, which allowed the robots at Vog-Sojoth to completely prevent any further liberation campaigns."}

During the months of June through October, it watched in panic as the pounced on its neighboring planets, first &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Achird%20III\"&gt;Achird III&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the Terminid crisis, the Colonial Overseer would wisely shut down all FTL Lines leading out of the planet, which would help keep Volterra safe from the fascist scourge.\nHowever, even such precautions couldn't protect Volterra from what would occur next. On December 28th, the ; an ancient enemy of Super Earth that was thought extinct, had returned to wage war on Managed Democracy once more. Following their vicious raid at &lt;a href=\"Julheim\"&gt;Julheim&lt;/a&gt;, the Illuminate then sent a raid onto Volterra, hoping to abduct its citizens and plunder its resources.\nAs such, the Helldivers; filled with righteous anger at the atrocities at Julheim, would deploy onto Volterra in full force, decided to avenge the lives lost. They battled against the Illuminate for 10 hours without faltering, managing to repel the invading force successfully and safeguarding Volterra's citizens and resources."}

Similar to battle passes from other games, Warbonds provide additional content for the game through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items for playing the game. Unlike battle passes, Warbonds are permanent and will never disappear, so you can purchase and progress through them whenever you want. The contents of a warbond can be unlocked by spending &lt;a href=\"Currencies%23Medals\"&gt;Warbond medals&lt;/a&gt; earned by playing missions or completing &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and personal orders. Warbonds can be standard or premium. Standard Warbonds are free, while premium Warbonds have to be purchased with &lt;a href=\"Currencies%23Super%20Credits\"&gt;Super Credits&lt;/a&gt; (their price can vary depending on the amount of content). Warbonds are divided into pages and players need to spend a certain amount of Medals on previous pages to unlock new ones.Warbonds can include the following items:\nWarbonds.\nBelow is a list of all currently available Warbonds:\nWarbonds FAQ.\nThe FAQ below is taken from the official Helldivers Discord server.\nQ. How do the Warbonds work? Is it a pay-to-win model?\nA. The goal with our Warbonds is to provide players with different gameplay experiences, but not unfair advantages when comparing the content. We designed Warbonds as an optional way to support Super Earth's war effort in the game and get access to additional gear for your Helldiver. Warbonds are unlocked with Super Credits, which can either be discovered at points of interest during missions or purchased through the in-game store. Once you own a Warbond, you can then use Medals you\u2019ve been awarded in-game to unlock more content. Warbonds are evergreen, so players are welcome to take their time in unlocking, and we'll be keeping things fresh with future updates containing new Warbonds to choose from.\nQ. Can we preview the content in them?\nA. Every time a new Warbond is released, you will be able to preview the content, and the Warbonds will never disappear, so you can purchase them or not whenever you want to.\nQ. If I only want one item from the Warbond, do I still have to pay to get that item?\nA. Yes, you must unlock the Warbond itself before you can spend medals on the items in it.\nQ. Can you progress two Warbonds at the same time?\nA. Yes you can progress your Warbonds any way you choose. If you have 2 Warbonds unlocked you can spend your first 50 medals in Warbond 1 and then switch and spend 50 medals in Warbond 2.\nQ. Can old Warbonds be purchased a year from now?\nA. Warbonds are evergreen, so players are welcome to take their time in unlocking, and we'll be keeping things fresh with future updates containing new Warbonds to choose from.\nQ. Are all the items in the Warbond strictly cosmetic?\nA. No, Some of the items in Warbonds have passive effects attached to them.\nQ. Will progressing through Warbonds separate me from other players?\nA. Nope! You will always be able to play all our content updates with other players who have only bought the base game. All other future updates, for example enemies, environments and missions will be free for everyone who's bought the base game.\nQ. Will Warbonds contain stratagems? (OUTDATED AS OF CHEMICAL AGENTS WARBOND).\nA. No. New stratagems will be added to the stratagem menu and be unlockable through in-game play. We may add them to Warbonds or SuperStore in the future.\nQ. Can you still earn medals without an active Warbond?\nA. You will always earn medals, no matter if you have outstanding Warbonds, completed Warbonds or no Warbonds\nQ. Is it possible to buy the DLC packs directly? Like buying a Warbond with money and not requiring you to buy the premium currency?\nA. You will not be able to buy the Warbonds directly with real money. You would need to purchase a pack of Super Credits and then buy the Warbond.\nQ. Will all future Warbonds contain some amount of Super Credits?\nA. Right now, the Warbonds we have designed contain SC. However, not every future Warbond will contain Super Credits but a lot of them will, and the SC inclusion may depend on the theme and size of the Warbond."}

{"id": "4966", "revid": "55339407", "url": "https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4966", "title": "Wasat", "text": "Wasat is one of the five planets in the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir sector&lt;/a&gt;. Its general landscape consists of rocky hills with flatter terrain in between. Wasat is a foggy, desolate, acidic planet. The planet became part of the Second Galactic War during an automaton attack on May 11th, 2184 during Operation Metallic Harvest. \nTopography.\nThe planet is covered in brown rocks and sand, stained yellow from the constant acidic environment. The skies are dense and dark and stained a teal color. Many mushroom shaped mountains and hilly structures cover the landscape, with rough flatter land in between. The lowlands are often filled with acid filled craters and terraced lakes. &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldiver forces&lt;/a&gt; should be aware of the threats posed by low visibility, acid rain, and potential drowning risks.\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nWasat had remained on the sidelines of the Special Military Operations conducted against the Automaton Expedition during the months of February and March of 2184. Like many other planets in the Ymir Sector, it had remained an unremarkable but highly patriotic colony of the Federation for 100 years, its citizens thriving among the acidic pools and tall plateaus that dot its yellowish green deserts. While there are some reports of skirmishes occuring here during the month of march, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed, through the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt; that these reports are unreliable and should be considered an attempt at psychological warfare by the Automatons or dissidents sponsored by them.\nDefense of Wasat (May 11th - May 12th 2184).\n&lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automaton&lt;/a&gt; forces attacked &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; on April 20th. The planet saw fighting, ultimately leaving the planet under Automaton control. Late April and early May saw Helldiver attention focused in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only small forces of a few thousand Helldivers per planet in the Western Front. Although the bulk of the Helldiver forces began to move west during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Metallic%20Harvest\"&gt;Operation Metallic Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, the Ymir sector was not well defended. The call for Helldiver assistance rang out on May 11th, 2184. Automaton forces had advanced from Meissa to Wasat. Immediately, thousands of Helldivers flooded in. Over 6,000 reinforcements had arrived within the hour, with fierce combat beginning promptly. The amount of Helldiver forces on the planet surface dropped gradually, with Automaton gains being largely unhindered by the end of May 11th. Most of the Helldiver forces operating in the West were concentrated on Lesath or Menkent, which were much more strategically significant. Only ~4,000 defenders were operating on Wasat. By the next day on May 12th, it was clear the planet was going to be lost.\nLiberation Campaign of Wasat (May 12th 2184 - June 3rd 2184).\nAutomaton forces captured Wasat late on the day of May 12th. A liberation campaign to retake the planet began in earnest, but only ~2000 Helldivers are active on the planet. As of May 12th, 45.8% of the planet was in democratic hands. The next day on May 13th, that number had fallen as low as less than 1,000. The planet fell to 19.7% liberation. Over time, the liberation percentage fell to negligible levels, as did the amount of Helldiver forces on the planet. At the lowest there were ~50 Helldivers operating on Wasat. \nThe fall of Vega Bay on June 3rd, 2184 cut off Wasat. The liberation campaign was abandoned fully, leaving Wasat under full automaton control.\nOperation Valiant Resistance (June 7th, 2184 - June 10th, 2184).\nWith Helldiver forces occupied on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;, the Automaton forces spread unchecked throughout the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; regions of the galaxy. Individual planets were captured nearly unimpeded. However, the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia Supercolony&lt;/a&gt; on June 2nd and the subsequent liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Umlaut%20Sector\"&gt;Umlaut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi sectors&lt;/a&gt; allowed Super Earth forces breathing room. With the situation in the East stabilized, the hands of liberty were now freely able to be wrapped around the neck of socialism. \nAlthough intelligence into the Automaton's methods and current objectives is still unclear, intelligence analysts were able to uncover an automaton database on Wasat, with High Command marking it's capture as an objective of vital importance. Nicknamed Database One, an offensive deep into the Ymir sector has been launched, with the target being Wasat. By June 10th, the &lt;a href=\"Helldivers\"&gt;Helldivers&lt;/a&gt; had successfully liberated &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt;, carving open the path to capture Wasat. The liberation campaign began late in the day of June 9th. The acidic. foggy environment made the battle on this day grueling; not to mention the mindless and ferocious resistance of the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;red pest.&lt;/a&gt; The fighting continued late into the day of June 10th, when Wasat was liberated. This also completed Operation Valiant Resistance. Some of the Helldiver forces on Wasat preceded to nearby &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile intrepid SEAF Cyberwarfare Specialists were able to breach the encryption of Database One, delivering the Federation a vast treasure trove of information that will likely take months for the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Intelligence\"&gt;Ministry of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; fully analyze. Even so, the Federation's intelligence analysts were also able to quickly identify valuable intelligence, key amongst this being confirmation that the Automatons are planning some sort of massive terraforming project on &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nOther decoded data includes detailed recordings of the impact of the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; Supercolony on &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Other keywords are referenced numerous times throughout the data trove, without additional details: Vessel 00, Nucleus, The Final Collective, and others. As our analysts continue to decode the vast database, new intel may be gleaned that will aid in the Federation's Valiant Campaign against the mechanical menace. For now though, High Command's strategic objective on the Automaton front has been affirmed. &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; must be liberated at any cost.\nOperation Starslayer (July 5th-July 8th).\nMajor combat operations resumed in the Ymir sector on July 3rd. The Automatons launched an attack towards &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt;, which was repulsed by July 4th. They began to counterattack nearby planets on July 5th to cut off Helldiver reinforcements to the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; systems. By July 5th, &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; had fallen, and &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; and Wasat were under attack. \nWasat is less strategically important than Vega Bay, which contains the supply line connecting Super Earth to the Ymir Sector front. With progress on Wasat looking grim, the Automaton forces suddenly yielded control of the system to Super Earth. These automaton forces would be dispatched to bolster counterattack efforts on &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; and Vega Bay. It would appear that the Automaton offensive on Wasat was a ruse to obscure their true target of Meissa. This ruse strategy was repeated less successfully on July 7th. \nAn automaton on offensive onto Wasat was handily repulsed. Halfway through this attack, the Automatons struck &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; from a position on Vega Bay. Helldiver forces rapidly moved to the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt; early into this offensive. With Wasat successfully defended, the Helldivers then returned to X-45 to continue their valiant resistance.\nMatar Bay Encirclement (July 17th - July 23rd).\nAfter the successful completion of Operation Righteous Expunge, automaton forces stuck on &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt; have send a meager and desperate invasion force into Wasat system. Automatons made their planetfall at evening of July 21st, 2184. Unfortunately, 24 hours later Automatons have overwhelmed SEAF and claimed control over the planet due to Helldivers leaving for Defense of &lt;a href=\"Turing\"&gt;Turing&lt;/a&gt;. The bots are still encircled, preventing them from making permanent gains. A small detachment of loyal divers begun slow and meticulous purge of the invaders."}

Helldivers can also equip one type of grenade, these cannot be swapped in the field. Whenever a Helldiver deploys to the field, they will be supplied with their chosen loadout and most of the respective ammo capacity (or full capacity with the &lt;a href=\"Boosters\"&gt;Hellpod Space Optimization&lt;/a&gt; booster).\nStratagem or Support Weapons are not provided in the standard loadout and must be called in with their respective Stratagem (though they can also be randomly found in the field). They have their own weapon slot, so any Helldiver can carry one in addition to the rest of their loadout. Unlike the other weapons, they are effectively lost on death and may be lost behind enemy lines until their stratagem comes off cooldown. This can also somewhat limit their available ammunition, though they can still get ammo from all the usual sources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Resupply\"&gt;Resupply&lt;/a&gt; stratagem (though only half the reserve capacity by default). They also aren't deployed with full reserve capacity by default. In both cases there are &lt;a href=\"Ship%20Modules\"&gt;Ship Module&lt;/a&gt; upgrades available to provide full capacity.\nAmmunition.\nEvery weapon has its own ammunition type and number of reserve mags/rounds (or heat sinks for laser weapons) a Helldiver can carry at once. Remaining ammunition in a weapon cannot be transferred, even if picked up while already carrying the exact same weapon. Reloading magazine-based weapons will always discard any ammo left in the current magazine, so it should be avoided unless its close to empty or easy opportunity to stock up is close at hand. The amount of ammo in each magazine also depends on the weapon itself and can range from marksman rifles with a few rounds each to rapid-fire machine guns with hundreds. A few weapons reload single rounds or partial capacity through clips.\nEnergy-based weapons have a lot of variation when it comes to their ammunition mechanics, and can be grouped into three types; plasma, laser and arc. \nPlasma weapons, such as the &lt;a href=\"PLAS-1%20Scorcher\"&gt;PLAS-1 Scorcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SG-8P%20Punisher%20Plasma\"&gt;SG-8P Punisher Plasma&lt;/a&gt; function essentially the same as standard weapons, relying on a set amount of cartridges that have a set number of shots each. \nLaser weapons like the &lt;a href=\"LAS-5%20Scythe\"&gt;LAS-5 Scythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LAS-98%20Laser%20Cannon\"&gt;LAS-98 Laser Cannon&lt;/a&gt; rely on heatsinks in order to fire, the more you fire the more heat builds up. If you stop firing before the heat builds up too much, the weapon will cool down until the heat meter depletes or you start firing again, but if the heat meter reaches 100% your weapon will stop firing and you will need to replace your heatsink. The only laser weapon that does not rely on heatsinks is the &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;LAS-99 Quasar Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, which shoots an explosive projectile rather than a beam and needs to charge up each shot and cool down afterwards.\nArc weapons, which are currently limited to the &lt;a href=\"ARC-3%20Arc%20Thrower\"&gt;ARC-3 Arc Thrower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ARC-12%20Blitzer\"&gt;ARC-12 Blitzer&lt;/a&gt;, seem to be some of the few weapons with truly infinite ammo, but also have both a limited rate of fire and low effective range as a tradeoff. While they don't rely on ammunition, they both have somewhat unique firing mechanics; the Arc Thrower needs each shot to be charged up for about a second before firing each shot, while the Blitzer technically fires automatically with a 1.5 second cooldown between shots.\nSome support weapons do not carry reserve ammo by themselves and require a special backpack (supplied alongside the weapon) to carry it instead. These can be carried by another player, if they are willing to remain close and provide a team reload as needed.\nDespite these limitations, sources of ammunition resupply are generally universal. Ammunition can be picked up from boxes found on the map, the &lt;a href=\"Resupply\"&gt;Resupply&lt;/a&gt; Pod or Supply Pack, which will automatically supply reserve ammo for every weapon (or ammo backpack) the Helldiver is currently carrying. This won't refill the currently loaded magazine however, and the source of ammunition is entirely used up, even if it only supplies a single item. Reloading weapons before picking up ammunition is generally preferable. Primary and secondary weapons always get their full reserve capacity back, Support weapons only get half without a specific ship module upgrade; superior packing methodology. Boxes found on the map work a bit differently and only provide a single magazine (or heat sink) for all weapons at the same time, including Support weapons. \nAmmunition is also a factor at play for most Defensive stratagem deployments and Vehicles, which cannot be resupplied. Sentries will automatically deactivate when they run out of it."}

Devoured by constant wildfires, it stands as the gateway into the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nTogether with other planets of its biome, Wezen features mostly mountainous terrain with narrow ravines, accompanied by occasional open plateaus. Elevation changes are rare, but once they appear they are quite steep. Any local flora consists of mostly hardy thorny shrubs, very low grasses, and colonies of exploding mushrooms.\nWeather.\nWeather conditions on Wezen are similar to other desert planets like &lt;a href=\"Hellmire\"&gt;Hellmire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Menkent\"&gt;Menkent&lt;/a&gt;. This consists of cycling firestorms and fire tornados, followed either by complete lack of clouds or heavy ash choked fog. Expect mostly low visibility as the world burns around you, with the clear weather being an exception. Local fire tornadoes are especially lethal, following random movement patterns and are capable of incinerating anything in mere seconds. The ground itself will stay aflame in its wake, so tread carefully. The hot weather also will also worsen overheating in some weapons such as &lt;a href=\"LAS-99%20Quasar%20Cannon\"&gt;Quasar Cannons&lt;/a&gt;. \nRemember - When on fire, Drop and Roll/Stim!\nHistory.\nSecond Galactic War.\nFirst Battle of Wezen (May 23rd-24th).\nOriginally far from frontlines, this planet was theorized to be targeted for invasion by Automatons on their speculative march to &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, such rumours quickly fell silent when Automatons Fleets were destroyed during Operation Swift Disassembly.\nThe planet came under direct attack on May 23, 2184, from direction of occupied &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt;. Despite heroic sacrifice of over 350 thousand helldivers, planetary defences and SEAF troops were overwhelmed shortly after noon on May 24th.\nSecond Battle of Wezen (June 7th-8th) (Operation Valiant Resistance).\nOn June 7th, 2184, High Command announced a liberation campaign against the Automaton Data Center One on planet Wasat, deeper in &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir Sector&lt;/a&gt;. Wezen was quickly identified by the Helldiver Corps as the best way to approach the target planet. The first &lt;a href=\"Super%20Destroyer\"&gt;Super Destroyers&lt;/a&gt; arrived on early afternoon of same day, however initial progress was slow but promising, enough so for High Command to send out a strategic update advising Helldivers to target Wezen. SEAF reinforcements quickly flooded in and progress was being made, with the planet being liberated on early hours of June 8th, 2184. \nThird Battle of Wezen (July 3rd - 4th).\nOn July 3rd, 2184, an Automaton attack from &lt;a href=\"Varylia%205\"&gt;Varylia 5&lt;/a&gt; reached the planet, at the same time as &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; in same sector was also struck by invasion fleet. The latter received a greater amount of troops due to its importance in Major Order, leaving Wezen to a grim fate. \nFourth Battle of Wezen July 4th - 6th).\nAfter the Automaton attack, a liberation campaign began on Wezen. However, with a more pressing defense campaign on &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X-45&lt;/a&gt; and a campaign to cut off the attack on &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; not many forces have been dedicated here. By July 5th, Wezen was nearly in full Automaton command. A small force of ~300 lone Helldivers is holding on by a thread to prevent the encirclement of the S.E.A.F forces in the Ymir sector, which includes over half of all Helldiver squadrons currently. Wezen fell on July 6th. 16,000 Helldivers are left surrounded in the remaining systems of the Ymir sector, desperately holding the line to protect the &lt;a href=\"X-45\"&gt;X system&lt;/a&gt;. \nOperation Liberty Crush &amp; Operation Vengeful Cleansing (August 2nd - August 4th).\nAfter the fall of Wezen, it would be under Automaton Occupation for the remainder of July, as the Helldivers would divert towards other objectives. However, Wezen wasn't lost yet as, soon after their victory at X-45, the Helldivers would manage to secure a defensive line of planets that split the bot front in half, with Wezen being within the encircled domain. As such, Super Earth High Command issued an order for the immediate recapture of the encircled planets, with Wezen as one of its key targets.\nThe battles were fierce, but despite the immense sacrifice, the Helldivers were too late in liberating Wezen, making Operation Liberty Crush a close failure, yet not completely in vain, as Wezen would still be liberated on the early hours of August 4th, during Operation Vengeful Cleansing. Furthermore the successful defence of &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;, both the &lt;a href=\"Ymir%20Sector\"&gt;Ymir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andromeda%20Sector\"&gt;Andromeda&lt;/a&gt; Sectors are once again securely in Super Earths hands. Whilst the Automaton's may have won the battle, strategy of dividing the bot forces is now a firm reality, with only &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vandalon%20IV\"&gt;Vandalon IV&lt;/a&gt; still in automaton clutches in the &lt;a href=\"Trigon%20Sector\"&gt;Trigon Sector&lt;/a&gt;, the Super Earth Armed Forces are well on their way to winning the war."}

The planet's proximity to &lt;a href=\"Vindemitarix%20Prime\"&gt;Vindemitarix Prime&lt;/a&gt; makes it a crucial ace up the sleeve against the Automatons. \nDuring the First Galactic War, this planet hosted a secret weapons research lab that was lost due to unknown reasons. However, in June 2184, in the midst of the Second Galactic War, the Helldivers defended the planet, allowing for the recovery of blueprints for an &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;intergalactic battle station&lt;/a&gt;. \nTopography.\nThe exact circumstances that caused the increase in radiation levels across the planet is currently unknown, with anything from nuclear meltdowns to orbital nuclear bombardment being a plausible explanation.. No human has set foot on the surface of X-45 in over one hundred years, one that is characterized by high heat and humidity and the majority of which is covered by swamps, marshes and bogs -- much of which is still contaminated by radiation.\nYet despite the negative effect of the radiation on human life, many scientists see an overall beneficial effect to the ecosystem. Though the immediate effects of the radiation were negative, the planet has recovered over the past century and today seems to have a healthy environment. The lack of people on the planet has also increased the biodiversity of X-45 since the first galactic war.\nHistory.\nFirst Galactic War.\nX-45 would be one of the few planets to see action during the First Galactic War. Sometime in 2084, an Advanced Weapons Laboratory would be constructed on the planet, with its research focus being mostly into the construction and maintenance of Interplanetary Battle Stations.\nHowever, misfortune would strike, as X-45's radiation levels skyrocketed due to the ongoing conflict. As such, the planet would be quickly abandoned and quarantined, leaving the laboratory and its valuable materials trapped away from Freedom's reach.\nDespite the Cyborg's Rebellion being quashed, Super Earth would not make any attempts in returning to the planet for 100 years.\nSecond Galactic War.\nX-45 had a strange luck attached to it. Despite the radioactive chaos, neither Super Earth nor any of its enemies would make any move towards the planet during the century after the disaster at the weapons laboratory. However, it would be this luck that saw X-45 ultimately become a beacon of hope in the Ymir Sector.\nFrom the months of March through May and into June of 2184, as the Automatons reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Cyberstan\"&gt;Cyberstan&lt;/a&gt; and slowly consumed the sectors surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Valdis%20Sector\"&gt;Valdis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, X-45 would slowly see its neighboring planets in the Ymir Sector fall one by one. First &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt;, both in the month of April. Then, after the failure of the Terminid Control System drew away more Helldivers from the Automaton Front, followed &lt;a href=\"Wezen\"&gt;Wezen&lt;/a&gt; at the start of May and then, in the last week of May, &lt;a href=\"Vega%20Bay\"&gt;Vega Bay&lt;/a&gt;. For a whole month, X-45 stood as the last bastion of Freedom amidst the oppression of the mechanized socialists.\nThen, with Operation Emancipator, the Helldivers would free X-45's neighboring planets, with only Meissa remaining reluctant about its return to Managed Democracy. Nevertheless, FTL Supply Lines to X-45 would be restored shortly after the liberation of the previously mentioned planets, fully returning it to Liberty's embrace.\nOperation Starslayer.\nOn July 3rd, 2184, X-45's luck would be finally put to the test. The long lost Advanced Weapons Lab would be rediscovered on the planet, buried underneath many tons of lightly irradiated, although sufficiently safe, rubble. However, as the radiation levels lowered, Super Earth High Command deemed the recovery of the Lab's research and material valuable enough to issue a Major Order, mandating that Helldivers maintain complete control of X-45 for the entire week, as research and excavation teams rush to recover the lab's work.\nAfter clearing the first layer of rubble covering the Advanced Weapons Lab, it was discovered that the facility was largely intact. High command theorized that that it was possible that other plans, or even caches of still-functional weaponry from the First Galactic War also contained in the lab might still be intact. Sure enough the excavation teams were eventually able to recover an intact cache of a lost Support Weapons: the &lt;a href=\"MLS-4X%20Commando\"&gt;MLS-4X Commando Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. These weapons were immediately put to use in defense of the planet, which had become desperate after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe defense of the X system was dependant on the Helldiver's ability to defend multiple strategic systems at once. The Ymir sector is deep within Automaton space and was only recently liberated during &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Firewall\"&gt;Operation Valiant Resistance.&lt;/a&gt; The planets of the Ymir sector have been constantly assaulted over the course of the Operation Starslayer. Major fighting began on July 3rd. A minor assault into the X system was repulsed. Vega Bay was taken by July 6th, and was used as a secondary direction for the attack. \nThe automatons frequently used a new tactic of feint attacks to disguise their immediate target. Twice, &lt;a href=\"Wasat\"&gt;Wasat&lt;/a&gt; was attacked to disrupt Helldiver defenses. First on July 5th, when Automaton forces assaulted &lt;a href=\"Meissa\"&gt;Meissa&lt;/a&gt; unsuccessfully. The tactic began again on July 8th to attack the X system, but their pityful bluff would once again be called, with the Helldivers managing to succeed in both the defenses of X-45 and Wasat. However, where the Automatons did manage to succeed, they spread reckless, unrestrained cruelty, such as in the massacre of &lt;a href=\"Aesir%20Pass\"&gt;Aesir Pass&lt;/a&gt; on July 6th. \nWith many sacrifices made, the Helldivers have managed to make their valiant stand against the mechanized menace on X-45 excellently, with noble courage and tireless vigor, they bought enough time for the plans for the &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20Space%20Station\"&gt;interplanetary battle station&lt;/a&gt; to be received. Whilst the fate of X-45 itself remains unclear, with the plans recovered, the research station has been destroyed. The &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt; will find nothing there but lightly irradiated ash. Furthermore, remaining MLS-4X Commandos have been successfully shipped off-planet, enabling rapid production of the weapon. It will shortly be available for requisition fleetwide."}

For Hatred is embedded into their code.\nBy September 2184, the Tanis Sector had become a frontline of the Second Galactic War, as the Automatons itched to get the resources necessary to restart their expansionist campaigns after the complete eradication of their western holdings at the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Troost\"&gt;Troost&lt;/a&gt; back in August.\nAfter the fall of Clasa on September 19th, Yed Prior and Zefia became encircled alongside with nearby &lt;a href=\"Demiurg\"&gt;Demiurg&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted the colonial officials of the 3 planets to immediately commence preparations for a potential invasion.\nAfter the fall of Zefia on October 23rd, Yed Prior's colonial defenders would receive news of a buildup of Automaton forces at Clasa as they prepared for a new assault. With Zefia's refugees piling up at Yed's spaceports, the situation was critical, and when the Automatons eventually attacked Yed Prior on October 27th, shortly after Liberty Day, Yed Prior's colonial defenders were overwhelmed and, as such, called for the Helldivers.\nHowever, the Helldivers, having to devote resources for the defense of &lt;a href=\"Gatria\"&gt;Gatria&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20Xi%20Sector\"&gt;Jin Xi Sector&lt;/a&gt; and the Terminid Research Preserve with it, were unable to answer to Yed Prior's call.\nYed Prior would fall on October 28th, after a valiant yet feeble defense against the robotic menace, its colonists going into hiding in secret underground bunkers and safe havens throughout the planet, as all FTL Lines connected to Yed Prior led to Automaton space."}

The planets blazingly hot surface forces Helldivers to suffer the Intense Heat Enviromental Condition and its rocky mesas are the only things visible within the almost infinite feeling spread of sand and dunes. As similar to &lt;a href=\"Durgen\"&gt;Durgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Choohe\"&gt;Choohe&lt;/a&gt;, Zagon Prime features occasional sandstorms on its surface which causes Helldivers and enemies alike to have reduced mobility and greatly reduced visibility which can prove both incredibly useful and overwhelmingly deadly.\nHistory.\nSpecial Military Operations.\nOperation Prime Liberation.\nZagon Prime was one of the primary objectives in the operation along with &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; but was unable to be liberated in time for the end of the Major Order.\nFailure of the TCS System.\nHours before the TCS fail and &lt;a href=\"Major%20Orders%23Operation%20Firebreak\"&gt;Operation Umlaut Firebreak&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Omicron\"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt; had reached 70% liberation this is the closest that the Helldivers have ever come to returning to Zagon Prime since it was attacked and lost on February 8th.\nSecond Galactic War.\nOperation Hive Breaker.\nWhilst not directly linked to the operation itself, Zagon Prime would eventually see some minor action after the liberation of the nearby FTL connected planet of &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivel 43&lt;/a&gt; during the Major Order. At the time of &lt;a href=\"Nivel%2043\"&gt;Nivels'&lt;/a&gt; liberation, only &lt;a href=\"Fori%20Prime\"&gt;Fori Prime&lt;/a&gt; was left to be captured for the order, allowing some Helldivers to travel to Zagon in hopes of pushing the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminid&lt;/a&gt; scum further back. It is also worth noting that this is the first time Helldivers have been able to step foot on Zagons' harsh planet since the TCS failure roughly 2 months prior.\nLandfall was made by the Helldivers on the 21st of June."}

However, the Automatons, envious of Super Earth's progress and prosperity, would force Zefia into the conflict.\nOn September 19th, the Automatons would violently occupy the nearby planet of Clasa. However, thanks to the Helldivers' righteous interference, they would be unable to make much moves onto any of the planets connected. As such, Zefia stood on guard as it monitored the developing Automaton force on Clasa while discretely evacuating its research materials.\nFor almost a whole month, the colonists at Zefia watched Clasa closely, anticipating an attack. On October 9th, 2184, their expectations became true, as the Automatons launched an attack onto Zefia. However, in their delay, they had allowed the Helldivers to mobilize towards Zefia en masse. Zefia was successfully defended by the end of the day and allowed the Helldivers to return to other planets without much incident.\nInterim (Oct. 22nd - Oct. 23rd).\nEver since, Zefia has remained free. However, the Automatons, as baked into their programming, could not bear to see free and prosperous planets. As such, they would launch an attack onto Zefia on October 22nd, pretty much hours after their special strike force, the Jet Brigade, had been decisively defeated at &lt;a href=\"Marfark\"&gt;Marfark&lt;/a&gt;.

Mainly an afterthought in the Federation of Super Earth, its extremely cold temperatures and grey, barren ground and skies painted the world in a dark shadow in the outskirts of its galaxy. It and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Gellert%20Sector\"&gt;Gellert Sector&lt;/a&gt; would see relatively no action or violence for the 100 years following the first galactic war.\nHowever, Super Earth's enemies would not bear to see peace and prosperity in the sector. Late in October 2184, the Gellert Sector would make an unprecedented call for help from Liberty's elite force, the Helldivers. The few colonists settled in the sector watched in horror as the &lt;a href=\"Automatons\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;, who had just recently taken control of bordering &lt;a href=\"Zefia\"&gt;Zefia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yed%20Prior\"&gt;Yed Prior&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tanis%20Sector\"&gt;Tanis Sector&lt;/a&gt;, would mount an offensive into the Gellert Sector, taking control of both &lt;a href=\"Blistica\"&gt;Blistica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mintoria\"&gt;Mintoria&lt;/a&gt;. The Automatons would then attempt to take &lt;a href=\"Zzaniah%20Prime\"&gt;Zzaniah Prime&lt;/a&gt;- Zosma's neighbor- but would be easily repelled by the Helldivers in an impressive display of cooperation. \nHowever, the peace of Zosma's neighbor would not last, as the Automatons would launch a combined 16 Battalions from Blistica and Mintoria towards Zzaniah Prime in late November, a much stronger invasion fleet than their first attempt. This time, the robots would be successful, as the Helldivers were concerned with a then-Major Order sending the Corps towards the Terminid front. This, coupled with Zzaniah's location on the galactic fringe, as well as a large assault on &lt;a href=\"Fenrir%20III\"&gt;Fenrir III&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Terminids\"&gt;Terminids&lt;/a&gt;, meant that very few Helldivers would heed Zzaniah's call for aid. As such, the planet was captured on November 27, 2184. Zosma was now under severe threat, as its only connection to the rest of the galaxy was through its sandy neighbor that was now overtaken by the iron grip of the Automatons. Zosma's colonists were now hoping for the best- but preparing for the worst."}
